            "content": "Chapter 33: Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply . The economy has some years in which activity increases and others where activity decreases A period of contraction is called a recession if it is mild and a depression if it is severe | . | The model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply can help explain how short-run fluctuations occur and are caused | . 33-1: Three Key Facts about Economic Fluctuations . Fact 1: Economic Fluctuations Are Irregular and Unpredictable . Fluctuations are often referred to as the business cycle in which business is good during times of growth and business is bad during times of contraction The term cycle is misleading, as the fluctuations do not follow a set pattern, and the economy can expand or contract seemingly randomly | . | . Fact 2: Most Macroeconomic Quantities Fluctuate Together . Quantities such as real GDP, income, profits, spending, etc. decrease when the economy contracts and increase when it expands Move in same direction but by different amounts | Contraction is mostly caused by reduced spending on new factories, housing, and investments | . | . Fact 3: As Output Falls, Unemployment Rises . If a firm decides to produce fewer goods, then they need to employ less people, so recessions often raise the unemployment rate | . 33-2: Explaining Short-Run Economic Fluctuations . The Assumptions of Classical Economics . Classical economics assumes that the amount of money and price levels does nothing to affect the economy; at the end of the day, the demand for jobs, food, etc. remains the same Thus, any changes in money are nominal, or insignificant, over time | . | . The Reality of Short-Run Fluctuations . Most economists believe that the classical economic theory applies to the world in the long run but not in the short run | In the short run, real and nominal variables affect each other and affect real GDP | Thus, to analyze economics in the short run, we must use a new model | . The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply . This new model of economic fluctuations focuses on two variables: the output of goods and services (represented by real GDP) and the average level of prices (represented by the CPI or GDP deflator) The model is called the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply which places the price level on the vertical axis and the output level on the horizontal axis | The aggregate-demand curve shows the quantity of goods demanded at each price level while the aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of goods sold at each price level | . | This model differs from the simple supply-demand curves because it covers multiple markets and products, not just one microeconomic market | . 33-3: The Aggregate-Demand Curve . Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward . Model of the curve: | Recall that the GDP can be represented using the following equation: Y = C + I + G + NX These variables all affect the aggregate-demand curve | Assuming that government spending is constant, we must exmaine how the price level affects the demand of goods and services for each of the variables | . | The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect A decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes consumers wealthier, thereby encouraging them to spend more. The increase in consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, an increase in the price level reduces the real value of money and makes consumers poorer, thereby reducing consumer spending and the quantity of goods and services demanded. | . | The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect If the price level is lower, then households need to hold less money, thus incentivizing investment | A higher price level discourages investment because households need to hold more money | Therefore, a lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending on investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, a higher price level raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, and decreases the quantity of goods and services demanded. | . | The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect A lower price level lowers the US interest rate, causing investors to invest abroad Abroad investing lowers the value of the dollar compared to the value of the euro, as firms must convert their dollars to euros (thus increasing the supply of dollars and lowering the supply of euros worldwide) | This change in currency values causes foreign products to become more expensive and domestic products to become cheaper, causing exports to increase and imports to decrease | . | Thus, when a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real value of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation stimulates U.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, when the U.S. price level rises and causes U.S. interest rates to rise, the real value of the dollar increases, and this appreciation reduces U.S. net exports and the quantity of goods and services demanded | . | Summing Up A fall in price level causes: Consumers to be wealthier, increasing the demand for consumption goods | Interest rates to fall, increasing the demand for investment | Currency to depreciate, increasing the demand for net exports | | The same applies in reverse, so if price levels rise, demand decreases | These explanations all assume that the money supply is fixed, and a changing money supply can shift the curve | . | . Why the Aggregate-Demand Might Shift . Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption If Americans en masse begin consuming less (more concerned about saving), then the aggregate-demand curve will shift to the left | If Americans en masse begin consuming more (less concerned about saving), then the aggregate-demand curve will shift to the right | Taxation is a big way to affect the level of consumption, as cutting or increasing taxes can heavily influence consumption | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment Many events can change the amount firms want to invest, including technological advancements, tax policy, money supply, etc. | An event that causes investment to increase shifts the curve to the right while an event that causes investment to decrease shifts it to the left | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases If the government begins spending more or less, then the aggregate-demand curve will shift | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports Events that cause exports to decrease shifts aggregate demand, such as an international recession, increase in value of the US dollar, etc. | . | Summing Up | . | . 33-4: The Aggregate-Supply Curve . Represents the quantity of goods and services that firms produce and sell at a given price level | It is important to know that the aggregate-supply curve is vertical in the long run but slopes upward in the shortrun | . Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Is Vertical in the Long Run . In the long run, an economy’s production of goods and services (its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and on the available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services. This means that an economy’s output will remain relatively constant in the long run save for advancements; tldr real GDP does not change | Price level does not affect real GDP because of monetary neutrality | However, the classical dichotomy and theory of monetary neutrality only applies in the long run, so the aggregate-supply curve is vertical only in the long run | . | . Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift . The natural level of output is the level of production that occurs when unemployment is at its normal/natural rate Also known as the potential or full-employment output | Changes in the natural level of output thus shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve which can be attributed to various factors | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor If an economy experiences an influx of workers, then there is more production in the economy, shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right (and vice versa if workers leave) | Any changes to the natural rate of employment through policy can also shift the curve, such as increases to unemployment insurance or better training for the unemployed | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital An increase in capital will increase productivity and thus increase the quantity of goods and services, shifting the curve to the right (and vice versa if capital decreases) | This observation applies to either physical capital (machines, factories) or human capital (college degrees) | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources Discovery of new natural resources can increase productivity and shift the curve to the right (and vice versa if some natural resources become unavailable) | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Technological Knowledge As new techonology is developed and employed, producitivity increases in all sectors and shifts the curve to the right | Trade can act as a sort of “technological knowledge” while the prevention of certain methods can pose a reduction in technological knowledge | . | Summing Up Policies and events that affect the real GDP can also be described as affecting the long-run aggregate-supply curve | . | . Using Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply to Depict Long-Run Growth and Inflation . Over time, technological knowledge will advance and increase an economy’s natural level of output while the government will print more money and raise the price level, causing both inflation and a growing output | Recall that the short-run model of aggregate supply and demand will have fluctuations that vary away from the long run model Thus, the short-run fluctuations in output and price level discussed in this chapter should be viewed as deviations from the long-run trends of output growth and inflation | . | . Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run . The main difference between the long run and short run economy is the difference in the aggregate-supply curve in the short and long runs While the long-run curve remains unaffected by short-run changes in price level, the short-run curve is affected by such changes, causing it to slope upwards | Three main theories for why the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward, but all theories boil down to one basic reason: The quantity of output supplied deviates from its natural/long-run level when the actual price level in the economy deviates from the expected price level | . | The Sticky-Wage Theory This theory proposes that the short-run aggregate-supply curve is affected by price levels because nominal wages are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions (i.e. the wages are “sticky”) | Sticky wages can be attributed to long term contracts and social expectations of fairness and value | If the wages are set for a certain price level and the actual price level ends up being below the expected price level, then the workers are overcompensated and firms are forced to lay off more of them (and vice versa if the actual price level is above the expected one) | Eventually, this short term change goes away because wages readjust according to the equilibrium level | . | The Sticky-Price Theory This theory proposes that the short-run aggregate-supply curve is affected by price levels because nominal prices are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions (i.e. the prices are “sticky”) | A contributing factor to the stickiness of prices is the existence of menu costs and other similar costs | If prices are set for a certain price level and the actual price level ends up being below the expected price level, then the firm’s prices are too high and they must cut back on production in order to recuperate their losses (and vice versa if the price level is higher than expected) | Eventually, short-term unadjusted prices are readjusted to reflect the actual price level, and production returns to its equilibrium point | . | The Misperceptions Theory This theory hinges on the relationship between suppliers and markets | If the overall price level falls below the expected price level, then suppliers might mistakenly believe that their and only their prices have fallen in the economy, causing them to reduce the amount they supply (and vice versa if the price level increases) | Eventually, suppliers realize their misperceptions and adjust accordingly | . | Summing Up All theories suggest that output deviates from the natural level of output due to an inaccuracy in expected price levels, expressed mathematically as so (where a represents the reaction to changes in price level): | All theories also provide reasons as to why the long-run curve will correct back to being vertical | . | . Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift . All ways to shift the long-run curve apply to the short-run curve as well, as changes to production would affect both curves | Additionally, changes in expectations to the price level will shift the short-run curve For example, according to the sticky-wage theory, when the expected price level is higher, costs will be higher due to wages, causing firms to produce less at each price level, shifting the curve to the left (and vice versa for lower expected price levels) | . | Generally, an increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease in the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. | Summary: | . 33-5: Two Causes of Economic Fluctuations . To analyze fluctuations, let’s first assume that the economy begins in long-run equilibrium | . The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand . To analyze the effects of a shift, consider the following four steps Decide which curve the event shifts: aggregate demand or aggregate supply (or both) | Decude which direction the curve shifts | Use the diagram of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to assess the impact on output and price level in the short run | Use the diagram to see how the economy moves from its new short-run equilibrium to its new long-run equilibrium | | Suppose an event occurs that causes demand to be lower This event will shift the aggregate-demand curve to the left | In the new equilibrium, the level of output and price level will fall due to the shift | People will eventually come to match their expectations with the new price level, and the expected price level matches the actual one, thus causing wages + costs to drop and firms to start producing more again This will then lead the economy back to producing at the long-run aggregate supply curve quantity | . | Graph: | . | Assuming that the government does nothing, then the level of production will slowly return to where it once was, but the government can aid the aggregate-supply curve into shifting to the right in order to match the long-run curve faster | Three important takeaways In the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the economy’s output of goods and services | In the long run, shifts in aggregate demand affect the overall price level but do not affect output | Because policymakers influence aggregate demand, they can potentially mitigate the severity of economic fluctuations. | . | . The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Supply . Suppose that an event occurs that increases firms’ costs of production This will shift the aggregate-supply curve to the left, causing the level of output to decrease but the price level to increase | Because the economy experiences both stagnation (decreasing output) and inflation (increasing price level), the economy is experiencing stagflation | The response to this curve could be that workers demand higher wages due to the higher prices, causing the firms’ costs of production to become even higher, making the problem worse Known as the wage-price spiral | . | The spiral will eventually stop because the workers have less bargaining power due to the low supply of jobs, thus lowering nominal wages and causing production to return to higher levels (AKA the aggregate-supply curve shifts back to the right) | The government can aid this problem by shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right in order to keep output at its natural level | . | Two important takeaways Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession (falling output) and inflation (rising prices). | Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can mitigate the adverse impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the problem of inflation. | . | .",

            "title": "Money Growth and Inflation",
            "content": "Chapter 30: Money Growth and Inflation . 30-1: The Classical Theory of Inflation . The Level of Prices and the Value of Money . The value that people place on things typically don’t change, but the value of their medium of exchange does; this explains why prices change year after year | Let P represent the price level as measured by the CPI or GDP deflator, which means that P equals the price of a basket of goods and services 1/P thus represents the goods and services that can be bought with $1 | Therefore, P represents the price of goods and services in terms of money while 1/P represents the value of money in terms of goods and services | . | . Money Supply, Money Demand, and Monetary Equilibrium . The money supply can be represented by the amount of dollars that the Fed puts out into the public through the use of buying bonds, changing rates, etc. For simplification, ignore the money multiplier and only consider the raw amount of money the Fed puts out | . | The money demand is represented by the amount of liquid money that people want and is influenced the interest rates that people could get for storing their money elsewhere The most important factor for the demand of money is the average level of prices in the economy; if prices are high, then people will need to hold more money as opposed to when prices are low | . | The supply and demand for money are balanced in the long-run due to the overall level of prices If the price level is higher than the equilibrium level, people will want to hold more money than is available, so the price level must fall | If the price level is higher than the equilibirum, people will want to hold less money than is available, so the price level must rise | Graph: | . | . The Effects of a Monetary Injection . After a monetary injection, the price level rises because there is more money in the economy, making each dollar less valuable Graph: | A decrease in money will thus decrease price levels | This theory correlating the quantity of moeny to price levels is called the quantity theory of money | . | . A Brief Look at the Adjustment Process . The monetary injection immediately increased the amount of money in the economy from the point of equilibrium | After the injection, there is now a surplus of money, and people will try to get rid of this surplus by purchasing goods and services, loaning it out to others, or saving it in banks | The level of production in the economy has remained unchanged, so there is a greater demand for goods and services but not a greater supply | Thus, the price of everything increases and reaches a new equilibrium where the price level is higher | . The Classical Dichotomy and Monetary Neutrality . The effects of monetary changes on otheer variables has been closely studied and has led to the following | There are two types of economic variables: nominal variables which are measured in monetary units and real variables which are measured in physical units The income that a farmer gets for selling his crop is a nominal variable, but the amount of crop he harvests is a real variable | This separation of variables into two different categories is known as the classical dichotomy | . | Relative prices (three phones are worth the same as desktops) are also real variables | Real variables include real interest rate, real wages, and much more | Real variables remain uninfluenced by changes in the monetary system while nominal variables are affected Think back to real GDP; an economy’s production is reliant on physical capital which has nothing to do with the amount of money in an economy | . | Changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables but not real variables; known as monetary neutrality Thus, in the long run, monetary changes do not affect real variables, but in the short run, they can have effects on them | . | . Velocity and the Quantity Equation . The velocity of money is the measure of how often money is transferred in an economy Calculated by multiplying the price level P by the quantity of output (or GDP) Y and dividing the product by the quantity of money M | V = (P * Y)/M | Can be rewritten as MV = PY which is known as the quantity equation for relating the quantity of money M to the nominal value of output PY | . | The velocity of money is often stable and can be assumed to be constant | The quantity theory of money can make use of the velocity of money to come up with 5 main points: | . The Inflation Tax . Typically, governments rapidly create massive amounts of money in an effort to pay for their spending instead of raising taxes The printing of money causes an inflation tax; the value of everyone’s money decreases while the government takes in revenue from printing money | . | The inflation tax typically comprises of a very little portion of the government’s revenue, but the rapid printing of money (usually done by smaller governments) causes higher revenue | Hyperinflation ends once the government pursues a fiscal policy that does not require them to print money, such as by cutting government spending | . The Fisher Effect . An increase in the rate of money growth will raise the rate of inflation but not affect any real variable; can be applied to interest rates and policy regarding saving and investment | As defined before, the equation for real interest rate can be written as follows: Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate | This equation can be rewritten as so: Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation rate Since the real interest rate is unaffected by any monetary policy, this equation thus means that an increase in the nominal interest rate will reflect a change in the inflation rate | Therefore, when the Fed increases the rate of money growth, both the inflation rate and the nominal rate will increase in the long run | This effect is known as the Fisher effect | . | Graph showing a correlation between the nominal interest rate and inflation rate: | . 30-2: The Costs of Inflation . A Fall in Purchasing Power? The Inflation Fallacy . Inflation does not affect real purchasing power because of the principle of monetary neutrality | Prices rising means that the average price of goods and services increases but so, too, does the salary of workers as a result of the increased prices | . Shoeleather Costs . The inflation tax affects all holders of money, and people will try to get around this tax by holding less money in cash and saving money in accounts that accrue interest The cost of reducing the amount of money you hold is called the shoeleather cost of inflation, named after the wear of your shoes after making frequent visits to the bank but realting moreso to the time and energy spent going to the bank to reduce the inflation tax | Especially prevalent in countries with hyperinflation, as people have to go to the bank often to convert their currency into more stable currencies | . | . Menu Costs . Firms incur a cost when changing prices, known as the menu cost, due to the materials and resources used to decide on new prices, update price lists, advertise, etc. | Firms try to change costs as little as possible, but in an economy with hyperinflation, some may have to change costs multiple times a year | . Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources . Suppose that a restaurant only updates its menu once a year, meaning that the relative price of their menu items will be the cheapest at the end of the year when inflation has run its toll | The fact that the relative prices are always changing makes it difficult to efficiently allocate resources, thus creating a cost of inefficiency | . Inflation-Induced Tax Distortions . Inflation often raises the tax burden on savings Suppose that an investment of $10 from 50 years ago is sold today for $100, but the tax is based on the difference between’s today price and the price fifty years ago of $90; this is not indicative of the difference in real purchasing power which means that the tax is much greater than it should be | Table representing savings in an economy with no inflation versus an economy with high inflation: | . | One way to get around this distortion is to index the tax system based on changing price levels, but this is difficult and complicated to do | . Confusion and Inconvenience . People are often confused that their $20 cannot buy the same things that it could the year prior, thus creating a new cost | Applies to investing, saving, purchasing, etc. which causes the allocation of resources to be inefficient | . A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary Redistributions of Wealth . Inflation can cause wealth to be redistributed through loans If the inflation rate rises at a much higher rate than the agreed upon interest rate of the loan, then the borrower will have to spend less real purchasing power to pay it off | If the inflation rate is low or the economy deflates, then the borrow will have to spend more real purchasing power to pay it off | Impossible to avoid these effects because inflation is difficult to predict | . | Higher inflation rates mean that inflation in that economy is volatile and uncertain, thus causing worse arbitrary redistributions of wealth | . Inflation Is Bad, but Deflation May Be Worse . Some economists support the idea that a small, predictable amount of deflation is good because it would lower the cost of holding money and encourage more spending (known as the Friedman rule) | In reality, deflation has some of the same costs as inflation such as menu costs and inconvenience | Deflation also puts money into the hands of loaners (who are usually rich) instead of debtors (who are usually poor) | Deflation is often a marker of macroeconomic crisis | .",

            "title": "The Monetary System",
            "content": "Chapter 29: The Monetary System . 29-1: The Meaning of Money . Money: The assets in an economy that people use to regularly purchase goods and services from each other Cash, credit cards, etc. are considered money while houses, investments are not | . | . The Functions of Money . Three functions: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value | A medium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers in exchange for their goods and services | A unit of account is a method to compare the value of two goods in an economy In prisons and extremely poor nations, cigarettes are often used as a unit of account | . | A store of value is an item that people use to transfer purchasing wealth from the present to the future A seller receives money now so they can buy something else in the future | . | Liquidity is the ease of which an asset can be turned into a medium of exchange Money is the most liquid while houses, paintings, etc. are not as liquid | Must balance liquidity with store of value; money is very liquid but can lose value easily with inflation, while paintings can increase in value over time but are not very liquid | . | . The Kinds of Money . Commodity money is money that takes the form of a commodity that has intrinsic value Gold has historically been used as money because it has many uses, thus giving it a high intrinsic value | Economies using gold (or that can easily turn their currency into gold) are said to be under a gold standard | . | Fiat money is money without intrinsic value, such as paper bills Fiat money is established as money by governments, but the value of fiat money is highly dependent on the confidence of the public in the government issuing the fiat money | . | . Money in the U.S. Economy . Money stock represents the amount of money circulating in an economy, but there are many different ways to measure it Currency is always included in the measurement of the money stock, but other things like demand deposits (money that can be easily accessed from a bank account) should also be included | Things like savings accounts, purchasing power on margin, etc. could all be considered part of the money stock; makes it difficult to measure | . | For the rest of this book, the money stock will include currency and deposits in banks and other institutions that can be easily accessed to buy goods and services | . 29-2: The Federal Reserve System . The agency responsible for regulating fiat money is the Federal Reserve (Fed) which is an example of a central bank in the United States | . The Fed’s Organization . Headed by a Board of Governors and one chair with 14-year terms and who are appointed by the president Federal Reserve System consists of the Federal Reserve Board and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks around the country | . | The Fed has two jobs Regulate banks and make sure the banking system is healthy, which is done by monitoring banks’ actions, loaning money to banks, and acting as a lender of last resort to failing banks | Control the quantity of money supply, or money available in the economy, through monetary policy | . | . The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) . The FOMC consists of all of members of the Board of Governors and all presidents of the regional banks Only 5 of the regional presidents get to vote with the votes rotating, but the New York branch president always gets to vote because NYC is considered the financial center of the United States | . | The FOMC decides to increase or decrease the number of dollars in the economy through open-market operation, or the sale and purchase of US government bonds If they want to increase money, they purchase bonds (money out, bonds in); if they want to decrease money, they sell bonds (money in, bonds out) | . | The Fed’s decisions regarding money supply highly infuence inflation in the long run and employment + production in the short run | . 29-3: Banks and the Money Supply . The Simple Case of 100-Percent-Reserve Banking . Assume that there is only $100 of currency, so the total supply of money is $100, and one bank that only takes deposits + doesn’t make loans Money that banks have received but not loand out are reserves | Because all deposits are treated as reserves, this system is called 100-percent-reserve-banking | . | The money in the bank can be represented with a T-account which is an accounting statement showing liabilities and assets Because the assets and liabilities are equal, this is considered a balance sheet | Because all deposits are kept in reserves, the supply of money remains unchanged; thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money | . | . Money Creation with Fractional-Reserve Banking . When a bank begins using the money in the reserves to give out loans, they keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve; thus, they are practicing fractional-reserve banking The fraction of deposits kept in reserves is known as the reserve ratio, and the Fed typically sets a minimum amount (called a reserve requirement) for the reserve ratio so bank runs don’t occur | Banks can also hold more than the reserve requirement for safety; known as excess reserves | . | Assume that the same bank uses a reserve ratio of 1/10, leading to this T-account: The amount of liabilities remains unchanged because making loans doesn’t change the amount the bank has to pay back to their depositors | The bank now has two assets: reserves and loans Loans effectively increase the money supply by $90, as there are 90 more dollars for borrowers to use | . | When banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money | . | Technically this doesn’t “create money”, as borrowers also take on liabilities by taking the loans, but the money in the economy becomes more liquid | . The Money Multiplier . Assume that the person who took the $90 from the first bank purchased something from a seller who deposited it into another bank The T-account for the secound bank would then look like this: | The total liabilities is $90 because the person deposited $90 and the bank can then loan out $81 out of the $90 | . | This pattern would continue if someone took a loan out from the second bank and bought from a member of a third bank: | Eventually, the total money supply jumps to $1000 after money is loaned out and reused again (100 + 90 + 81 + 72.90 + … + 0.9n * 100) The amount of money that the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier (10 dollars for each dollar) | The money multiplier is equal to the reciprocal of the resrve ratio Therefore, the lower the reserve ratio, the higher the money multiplier is and vice versa | . | . | . Bank Capital, Leverage, and the Financial Crisis of 2008–2009 . The example in the last two sections has been simplified, but most bank balance sheets also include equity and debt The resources that a bank gets from issuing equity to its owner is called bank capital which is used to make profit for its owners through actions such as purchasing stocks and bonds | . | Here is a T-account of a more realitic bank: The right side includes all of the liabilities and capital | The money on the right side is used to fund the items on the left, and the two sides must balance because of the rules of accounting | . | Businesses rely on leverage, or borrowing money in order to fund themselves and invest in capital | The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank’s total assets to the bank capital; in the above example, this ratio is 1000 to 50, or 20 This means that for each $20 of assets, $19 are financed with borrowed money | Assume that the value of the bank above’s assets rise by 5% This means that the assets are now worth $1050 while the liabilities remain the same (value of deposits and debt stay the same) | The owner’s equity now becomes $100 (1050 - 950) and thus increases by 100%, so a 5% increase turns into a 100% increase for owners | The opposite also applies; if there is a 5% decrease, then the owner’s quity goes down 100% as well | If the value of assets ever fall below the value of the liabilities, then tthe bank is considered insolvent and unable to pay off its debts in full | . | . | Banks are required to hold a certain amount of capital known as a capital requirement so they are guaranteed to pay off their depositors Illustrated in 2007 and 2008 crisis where the value of assets decreased so heavily that banks could no longer pay off their depositors and were forced to not loan out their money | Solved by adding money back to the economy which, in turn, made taxpayers partial owners of banks | . | . 29-4: The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control . How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves . Open-Market Operations Open-market operations is when the Fed buys or sells government bonds to decrease or increase the money supply, respectively | Easiest to do and does not require changes to laws or policy; used the most often | . | Fed Lending to Banks The Fed can lend money to banks, which happens most commonly when banks lack reserves | Banks typically borrow money from the Fed through the Fed’s discount window and pay an interest rate on the loan called the discount rate Giving banks money allows the banking system to create more money | Changing the discount rate changes the money supply; higher discount rate discourages banks from borrowing, thus decreasing the supply, while the opposite happens when the discount rate is lowered | . | Another way for the Fed to give money is through Term Auction Facitlities where loans were created and given to the highest bidder who would pay back the highest interest rate | The Fed lends money to banks when financial institutions are in trouble, such as during financial crises | . | . How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio . Reserve Requirements The Fed can change the reserve requirements which state the minimum amount of money the banks must hold in reserve | Increasing the requirement increases the reserve ratio which decreases the money supply, and vice versa for decreasing the requirement | Reserve requirements are rarely changed because they can cause banks to stop loaning money out and are less effective due to the common practice of holding excess reserves | . | Paying Interest on Reserves The Fed pays interest on reserves that banks hold at the Fed, thus encouraging saving money in reserves | The higher this interest rate, the more reserves are held and the lower the reserve ratio is; vice versa applies | . | . Problems in Controlling the Money Supply . There are two main issues that arise with attempting to control the money supply The Fed cannot control the amount of money that households decide to deposit into banks Especially problematic if a large number of households decide to take out their money and run the bank; causes issues without the Fed being able to do anything | . | The Fed cannot control the amount that banks lend to people Banks might decide to stop loaning money for an arbitrary reason outside of the Fed’s control, thus lowering the money supply | . | . | These two problems illustrate the dependence of the economy on the behavior of both banks and households, but they can be mitigated through careful observation | . The Federal Funds Rate . The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge one another for loans These loans are typically short and only used for small injections | Different than the discount rate, as banks are borrowing from other banks instead of the Fed Discount rate and federal funds rate is typically pretty similar | . | The federal funds rate influences the entire market due to its effects on banks | Open-market purchases raise the federal funds rate while open-market sales decrease it (less money means more banks need loans and vice versa) | A decrease in the target goal for the federal funds rate means the money supply will increase while a decrease in the target goal signals a decrease in money supply | . | .",

learned English there | 1919 - Moves back to China and joins nationalist + leftist student groups after mass protests occur due to growing European influence | 1920 - Zhou studies in France and joins the CCP, creates a link between the Chinese diaspora in Europe and the mainland Chinese party (CCP) | 1924 - Returns to China to build revolution | Very similar to Tan Malaka in the sense that both men became communist after studying abroad (in Europe) | . | The Chinese Path to Communism In the 1920s, China was considered one state but was controlled by different forces (middle of China controlled by warlords while foreign powers controlled the coast) The Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party, or KMT) formed to unify China by expelling foreign powers and forming a strong central government; supported by the Soviet Union | . | 1923-1927 - CCP allies with the Guomindang, similar to “bloc within” strategy where CCP members were encouraged to join the Guomindang | Guomindang splits into a right and left wing faction, with the left wing being closer to the CCP and the Soviet Union | 1927 - The right wing faction take over the Guomindang and kill the communists The Soviet Union demands that the CCP remain loyal to the Guomindang, creates tension between the Chinese and Soviet parties, disillusions many Chinese communists with the Comintern | Mao Zedong ignores Soviet advice; CCP must abandon cities, relocate to countryside, unite with the peasantry, and create areas in the countryside to use as bases to fight the Guomindang with guerilla warfare | . | Maoism becomes a separate part of communism (a brand of Chinese communism) because of his new strategy of working with the “common man” to defeat the Guomindang (control the countryside to cut off the cities) Mao gains power within the CCP and the CCP pursue his strategies throughout the 1930s and 1940s | . | . | Sino-Soviet Split 1949-1958 - China is closely allied with the Soviet Union and is reliant on Soviet military aid and loans; Zhou Enlai, as premier and foreign minister, negotiates with Moscow | Tension rises because Soviet and Chinese communism differs, especially with regards to peasantry Soviets argue for collectivization, government takes control of the peasantry + agriculture to drive profits and create industry | Chinese wants to work with the peasantry instead of “extracting profits” from them; use loans instead of countryside to industrialize and build infrastructure | . | Stalin dies in 1953, and in 1956, the new Soviet leader, Khrushchev, denounces Stalin as a tyrant who murdered his people and distorted the message of communism Khrushchev creates a more liberal period of Soviet politics with less authoritarianism;

            "content": "Chapter 27: The Basic Tools of Finance . 27.1: Present Value: Measuring the Time Value of Money . The present value of a future sum of money is the amount of money that would need to be saved today in order to reach that future sum via interest rates | The future value of a current sum of money is the amount of money that it would be worth after a number of years due to interest rates | Typically, the present and future values of money are calculated assuming that interest is compounded After n years and an interest rate of r, $100 becomes 100 * (1 + r)n dollars | The opposite is also true; if you receive 100 dollars n years from now, then the present value of that 100 becomes 100/(1 + r)n | . | The present and future value of money can be applied to many things, such as investments or receivement of payments | . Chapter 28: Unemployment . 28-1: Identifying Unemployment . How Is Unemployment Measured? . Adults (defined as people aged 16 or older) are placed into one of three categories when considering unemployment Employed - Anyone working, whether full-time or part-time, or those taking a temporary absence such as vacation, sickness, etc. | Unemployed - Anyone not employed, currently available for work, and trying to find employment for the past 4 weeks; also includes those who were laid off but are still working for the company | Not in the labor force - Anyone not in the above two categories, such as students, retirees, or homemakers | . | The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed Labor force = Number of employed + Number of unemployed | . | The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people divided by the size of the labor force Unemployment rate = Number of unemployed / Labor force * 100 | . | The labor-force participation rate measures the proportion of adults working in the labor force Labor-force participation rate = Labor force / Adult population * 100 | . | Between different groups of people, the unemployment rate and labor-force participation rate differ | The unemployment rate typically fluctuates The rate at which the unemployment rate hovers is called the natural rate of unemployment, while the deviations from the natural unemployment rate are called cyclical unemployment | Graph: | . | . Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It to Measure? . Measuring unemployment is not straightforward, as movement into and out of the labor force is common 1/3 of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force, such as young workers who are looking for their first jobs or old workers who want to reenter | Almost half of all unemployments end when the unemployed person leaves the labor force | Some who say they’re unemployed might be doing so in order to get unbemployment benefits | Some who leave the labor force are discouraged workers, or people who tried hard to get a job and failed | . | . How Long Are the Unemployed without Work? . Unemployment can be considered as follows: Most spells of unemployment are short, but most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term. | This means that there are people who are chronically unemployed that make up a majority of the unemployed, but most people who are unemployed regain jobs quickly and don’t affect the unemployment rate over time | . Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed? . There is always unemployment because there is always a surplus of labor; four reasons for this | Frictional unemployment explains shorter spells of unemployment that occur due to the delay of matching workers to jobs | Structural unemployment explains longer spells of unemployment that occur because the wages are set above the value defined by the labor-wage equilibrium This chapter will explore three types: minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages | . | . 28-2: Job Search . Job search is defined as the processs of matching workers with appropriate jobs Not an instantaneous process which is why unemployment occurs | . | . Why Some Frictional Unemployment Is Inevitable . Fricional unemployment occurs due to changes in demand of labor among different firms If Firm A increases in popularity and its competitor Firm B does not, then Firm B will lay off workers and Firm A will hire workers, causing a period of unemployment | If one industry experiences an increase in demands while another one experiences a decrease, then workers from the declining industry must search for jobs in the new one This is known as a sectoral shift and causes periods of unemplopyment due to the time it takes to find new jobs | . | In general, changes in demand between different industries and companies inevitably creates frictional unemployment | . | . Public Policy and Job Search . Though frictional unemployment is inevitable, how much it happens is not; the internet and faster flow of information can decrease frictional unemployment The government has tried to facilitate job search in many ways, such as government run agencies and public training programs (which trains workers in failing industries to get jobs in better ones) | Advocates claim that these programs help because it expands the labor force and reduces unemployment, while critics claim that the private market can do a better job than the government (such as through advertising or private education) | . | . Unemployment Insurance . Unemployment Insurance is the practice of giving workers protection against job loss; only given to those who were laid off and cannot find new jobs | Causes frictional unemployment because those who are unemployed are less inclined to find a new job if they know they can get money for doing nothing There are benefits: workers are less likely to take less lucrative job offers, thus increasing the quality of jobs, and workers find better matching jobs for their tastes | . | Point of much contention; economists are unsure of whether or not removing unemployment insurance would boost or diminish economic well-being | . 28-3: Minimum-Wage Laws . Minimumm wage laws cause unemployment because it forces wages to be above the equilibrium level, causing a surplus of jobs and unemployment Graph: | . | Though minimum wage laws do cause unemployment, they do not affect most people, as a majority of workers make well above the minimum wage Minimum wage affects the “marginal worker”, or those who have the least experience and the least skill | . | The graph shows an important conclusion: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any reason, the result is unemployment. | Note that minimum wage is very different from job search; while those searching for jobs are simply finding the best jobs to suit their tastes, those affected by a surplus of labor are waiting for jobs to open up because there is too much labor | . 28-4: Unions and Collective Bargaining . Unions are groups of workers who bargain with employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions Less prevalent in the US today, but still very active in Europe | . | . The Economics of Unions . Unions can be thought of as cartels but for labor Cartels are groups of sellers who join together to fix prices and exert market power; unions do the same but instead of selling goods they sell labor | The process of unions and firms agreeing on terms of employment is called collective bargaining | . | The bargaining power of unions largely comes in the form of strikes where all of the workers of a union stop working Because firms don’t want to lose profit, they will often strike agreements with unions to prevent strikes | . | The actions of unions raise the wage above the equilibrium level, resulting in a surplus of labor and unemployment Workers who are employed at the higher wage are better off, but those who were employed and got laid off are worse off | Those who maintain employment are called insiders and those who did not get the union jobs are called outsiders | Outsiders can either remain unemployed and try to get inside jobs or find jobs in other firms that are not unionized Because more workers look for jobs in un-unionized firms, the wages of such firms decreases; thus, unions increase wages in some parts of an industry while lowering it in others | . | . | Public policy allows for unions to exist, though the existence of unions is often debated politically | . Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy? . Critics of unions argue that unions are cartels, and by exerting their power, unions raise wagees too high and cause workers to be unemployed This causes an inefficient allocation of resources because higher wages reduces employment down to an inefficient level | Also inequitable; some workers benefit from the existence of unions while others do not | . | Advocates for unions argue that workers need market power of their own to combat the market power of firms, such as when firms create company towns or have overwhelming market presence otherwise Unions also help firms efficiently address workers’ concerns because they act as a means of communication between the two, leading to a happier and more productive workforce | . | . 28-5: The Theory of Efficiency Wages . Efficiency wages represent the idea of keeping wages above equilibrium to increase efficiency in various ways | . Worker Health . Workers who are paid more have a better diet, can afford health services, etc. which boosts their productivity Especially prevalent in poorer countries where firms are concerned that cutting wages too low will cause bodily harm to their workers | . | . Worker Turnover . Workers have incentives to quit their jobs, such as moving, finding a new job, leaving the labor force, etc. | By having higher wages, the firms encourage workers to stay and reduce turnover Turnover is detrimental for many reasons; have to train new workers, have to spend resources to hire new workers, etc. | . | . Worker Quality . The most talented, experienced workers want wages that are high to compensate, so companies will pay higher wages in order to weed out workers who might not be the most skilled for the job and only receive highly skilled applicants | . Worker Effort . Often, workers have the ability to determine how hard they work, and firms have a hard time figuring out whether or not a worker is shirking or not | Higher wages thus incentivize workers to stay on tasks in order to maintain their job and | .",

key disconnect between Marx and Engels’ idea of communism being born from a capitalist state | The Comintern was created to unite communists worldwide in order to develop communism in Western Europe | By 1920, the Bolsheviks are isolated both politically and geographically | . | Communism in the East The Soviets turn to Asia and support anti-colonist struggles in Asia to spread communism | The Comintern held a meeting in Azerbaijan with representatives from various movements throughout Asia Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the Comintern, calls for an alliance between the western proletariat and the peasantry of Asia | . | By creating a common enemy in Western Europe (colonizers), the Soviets create an alliance with Asian states | The idea of anti-colonialism contradicted with classic communism, as anti-colonialists were often wealthy and part of the native bourgeoisie The native bourgeoisie did not want to become communist; they simply wanted more power and were thus more conservative than revolutionary | The Comintern debated over this contradiction, as there was a lot of contention over the issue of hypocrisy | . | Before the Russian Revolution, much of Southeast Asia was colonized by Europeans | . | Communism and Pan-Islamism in the Dutch East Indies The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was founded in 1920 and was initially dominated by Dutch activists | The Islamic Union (SI) was a pan-Islamist organization that was anti-coonial Thought it was originally formed to protect Indonesian merchants, it expanded to recruiting poor peasants and working class | . | Many members of the PKI joined the SI and shared the same anti-colonist views, but they maintained their own separate identities Used the Comintern’s “bloc within” strategy where communists joined anti-colonial organizations to further their cause but maintained separation | . | . | Tan Malaka Indonesian (known then as the Dutch East Indies) communist, born in Java | Map of his travels: | Born into an aristocratic family and learned Dutch, different European languages | Becomes interested in communsim after studying in Netherlands, joins socialist teachers’ union | When returning to the Dutch East Indies, he joins the PKI and is active in gaining support for it within the SI | 1921: Elected chairman of the PKI, arrested and exiled a year later Extremely popular in the Netherlands, almost wins an election and gains support inside of the Comintern | . | Advocated for the marriage of Pan-Islamism and communism in order to further their cause, especially in Asia, in a speech to the Comintern Communist propaganda typically were anti-Islamic, Malaka wants them to ally with them | Defends “bloc within” strategy and criticizes the Comintern’s judgemental attitude towards Islam | Argues that Islam is a historically progressive religion and aligns with Christianity as an Abrahamic religion Communism could extend Islam’s progressive legacy in East Asia | . | . | Comintern is impressed with Malaka, appoints him as their representative in Indonesia | 1923: Malaka goes to Guangzhou, China to organize communist activities throughout Southeast Asia | 1925-1927: relocates to Manila, Philipines | Two brutal events in 1927 Comintern support a PKI uprising against the Dutch to which Malaka disapproves;

            "content": "Chapter 26: Saving, Investment, and the Financial System . The financial system consists of the institutions that match one person’s savings with another perosn’s investments Think of banks; people can deposit money into banks, and the banks use that money to give loans out | . | . 26-1: Financial Institutions in the U.S. Economy . Various incentives for people to both save and borrow, so the financial system matches the two together | Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: financial markets and financial intermediaries | . Financial Markets . Financial Markets are institutions where people who want to save can directly give funds to people who want to borrow Two main financial markets: bond and stock market | . | . Bond Market . When a company wants to borrow money, they can sell bonds to do so | Bonds are essentially IOU agreements, and the bond buyer loans money to the bond seller | Bonds identify the date of maturity, or when the loan will be repaid, and the rate of interest the seller will pays until the loan matures and the principal, or initial amount borrowed, is paid off | Bonds have four different characteristics that differentiate them Term: How long it will take for the bond to mature; occasionally, this will be indefinite, and such a bond is called a *perpretuity Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because you might need the money back faster, so long-term bonds usually have higher interest rates | . | Credit Risk: The likelihood that the bond seller will fail to pay the interest or principal Failure to pay is called a default, and corporations with higher chances of defaulting will issue junk bonds which have high interest rates in the hopes that someone will buy their bond | . | Tax Treatment: The way that taxes affect the interest earned on a bond State or local government issued bonds called municipal bonds are not taxable, so they have lower interest rates than corporate or federal bonds | . | Inflation Protection: Whether or not a bond will increase the interest paid back over time to reflect changes in inflation Bonds with inflation protections typically pay a lower interest rate than those without it | . | . | . Stock Market . A stock is a piece of the company that one can purchase in order for the company to raise funds | Selling stocks to raise money is known as equity finance, while the sale of bonds is called debt finance | Stockholders will gain a profit if the company they hold stock in is profitable while bondholders will not, but if the company does poorly, then the bondholders will maintain their same interest rates while stockholders will have stocks with a lower value Overall, stocks are more risky but more lucrative | . | After a corporation begins selling stocks, the shares are traded amongst stockholders on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ The price of shares depends on the supply and demand of the stock | . | A stock index is the average of a group of stock prices, such as the SNP 500 or Dow Jones Inudstrial | . Financial Intermediaries . Financial intermediaries are institutions in which savers indirectly provide money to borrowers Two main types: banks and mutual funds | . | . Banks . Banks use deposits from people who wants to save and uses it to finance loans from borrowers | Banks are profitable because the interest rates on their loans are higher than the interest rates they pay back on deposits | Banks also provide a medium of exchange in the form of credit/debit cards which allow people to easily make transactions Included in this is that they allow for a store of value for wealth that people have saved | . | . Mutual Funds . Mutual funds are institutions that sells shares to the public and uses the money raised to buy a portfolio of different stocks and bonds Shareholders of a mutual fund accept the risk associated with the portfolio; if it rises in value, then they benefit, but if it falls, then they suffer the loss | . | One advantage of mutual funds is that they allow those with small amounts of money to diversify their holdings, as it’s difficult to buy a fraction of a stock share | Another advantage is that it gives ordinary people access to the skills of professional portfolio managers, thus making it a more effective use of money This advantage is controversial, as it is often difficult to “beat the market”, and typically, index funds outperform mutual funds | . | . 26-2: Saving and Investment in the National Income Accounts . Various macroeconomic variables affect the financial markets, and this section will focus on using accounting to calculate the effects of these factors | . Some Important Identities . GDP is total income in an economy and the total expenditure on the economy’s goods and services Therefore, GDP (Y) is divided into the four components of expenditure: consumption (C), investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX) | Y=C+I+G+NX{Y = C + I + G + NX}Y=C+I+G+NX | . | Making an assumption that an economy is a closed economy that does not engage in trade makes it easier to analyze this identity In closed economies, there is no trade, so NX = 0 | Y=C+I+G{Y = C + I + G}Y=C+I+G | Therefore, every output sold in an economy is consumed, invested, or bought by the government | . | Using algebra we get the following: Y−C−G=I{Y - C - G = I}Y−C−G=I | . | Y - C - G is the total income in the economy that remains after consumption and government pourchases, which is also known as national saving or saving (S) Thus, S=I{S = I}S=I | . | Let T represent the amount that the government collects in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form of transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare) With T, we can define S as S=Y−C−G=(Y−T−C)+(T−G){S = Y - C - G = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)}S=Y−C−G=(Y−T−C)+(T−G) | . | This splits saving into private saving (Y - T - C) and public saving (T - G) Private saving is the income (Y) households have left over after paying taxes (T) and consumption (C) | Public saving is the tax revenue (T) the governments has left over after paying for its spending (G) If T &gt; G, then the government has a budget surplus, and if T &lt; G, then the government has a budget deficit | . | . | The identity that S = I reveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving must equal investment This is done through financial intermediaries that turn savings into investment | . | . The Meaning of Saving and Investment . Investing refers to the purchase of new capital, such as a loan to buy a new house or build a building | Saving refers to excess income that is stored somewhere, whether it’s the stock or bond market | . 26-3: The Market for Loanable Funds . Assume that the economy has one financial market which is called the market for loanable funds Loanable funds refers to the income that people chose to save and lend out which investors borrow to fund new investment projects | In this market, there is one interest rate which is the equal to the return to saving and the cost of borrowing | . | . Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds . The supply in this market comes from those with extra income who wish to save and lend out, either directly (bonds/stocks) or indirectly (banks) In other words, saving is the source of supply for loanable funds | . | The demand in this market comes fromm households and firms who wish to borrow in order to invest, such as getting a mortgage on a house or building a new factory In other words, investing is the source of demand for loanable funds | . | The interest rate represents the price of a loan, as it is the amount that borrowers pay for their loans and the amount lenders receive for loaning Higher interest rate means less people will borrow and more will save, and lower interest rate means more people will borrow and less will save | An equilibrium occurs in the market: if the interest rate were lower, then more people will borrow causing lenders to raise the interest rate, and vice versa | Graph of supply vs. demand: | . | The interest rate in this market refers to the real interest rate rather than nominal | Similar to other markets, we can analyze different government policies and their effects on saving and investment based on the shifts in supply and demand | . Policy 1: Saving Incentives . Saving is vital to creating resources for capital accumulation and raising the GDP, thus leading to policies incentivizing saving Tax laws especially can be amended to encourage saving, such as putting a lower tax on bond iinterest payments | . | A policy that incentivizes saving will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right because more money will be saved and lent out This will thus lead to a lower interest rate and more investment | Graphic: | . | . Policy 2: Investment Incentives . An investment tax credit gives a tax advantage to a firm investing in capital, thus incentivizing investment | This policy would shift the demand of loanable funds to the right because more people will borrow in order to make investments Therefore, this policy will lead to a higher interest rate and greater saving | Graphic: | . | . Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses . If the government runs a budget deficit, then there is a lower supply of loanable funds because national saving is equal to private saving plus public saving Therefore, the supply of loanable funds will shift to the left because there is a lower amount of national saving | This causes a higher interest rate and less investment | Graphic: | The fall in investing due to government borrowing is called crowding out because, when the government borrows to finance its deficit, it “crowds out” private borrowers and investors | The negative effects of a budget deficit can be felt regardless of whether it was caused by excess government spending or tax cuts | . | If the government runs a budget surplus, it uses its savings to get rid of its government debt which contributes to national saving Thus, a budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 25: Production and Growth . Different countries have different levels of productivity and different GDPs | This chapter focuses on ways that these statistics can vary from country to country | . 25-1: Economic Growth Around the World . Consider the following table: | Clearly, there are differences in GDP between various countries, but a few things stand out Countries don’t always stay on top: The UK was the richest country in the world but is now behind US, Canada, and Germany | Countries don’t always stay poor: Japan, China, and Brazil have experienced incredible growth, taking them for poorer nations to middle-income/rich ones | . | This table shows that things can vary greatly, but what drives these changes? | . 25-2: Productivity: Its Role and Determinants . Why Productivity Is So Important . Consider an isolated economy that must sustain itself through its production and no foreign trade | The higher said economy’s productivity is, the higher its quality of life More goods produced means more abundance which means free time, specialization, etc. | . | Note that an economy’s GDP measures both total income and total expenditure, so GDP is often a good measure of quality of life for economies Higher GDP means more production | . | . How Productivity Is Determined . Different factors can affect an economy’s ability to produce | Physical Capital Workers are more productive if given tools to work with | The stock of equipment and structures used to produce goods and services is called physical capital, or often just capital | Consider a bakery; the baker requires a rolling pin, baking sheets, an oven, etc. to efficiently produce baked goods These factors of production are included in physical capital | . | Physical capital can also be used to create more physical capital; a miner mines ore to create nails to build a house | . | Human Capital Human capital refers to the knowledge and skills worker gain through education, training, and experience | A better quality of human capital means a higher productivity | Producing human capital requires labor and time, such as teachers, libraries, study, etc. | . | Natural Resources Natural resources refers to inputs into production that are found in nature, such as water, wood, land, etc. Renewable resources include forests, animal husbandry, etc. | Nonrenewable resources include oil and minerals | . | Differences in natural resources are a big factor for some of the differences in productivity US has great farmland, Middle East has a lot of oil, etc. | . | Some countries without many natural resources, like Japan, can thrive through international trade | . | Technological Knowledge Technological knowledge refers to the understanding of the most efficient ways to produce goods and services | Two types Common knowledge, such as the invention of Henry Ford’s assembly line; can be employed by everyone | Proprietary, such as Coca-Cola’s secret recipe; often patented and only used by the company who discovered it | . | “Technological knowledge is the quality of society’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the population has spent reading them. | . | . 25-3: Economic Growth and Public Policy . The following section details different policies governments can adopt to improve productivity | . Saving and Investment . Physical capital is a produced factor of production, so devoting more resources towards it can help improve future production Consider a country that uses all of its labor to make food; its production remains stagnant because it doesn’t improve | If said country used half of its labor to make tools, then in the following year, it would be able to produce more food using the new tools | . | In general, saving and investment can enocourage growth and improve an economy’s standard of living in the long run | . Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect . If a government passes a new saving rate, how long will they enjoy an increased rate of growth? | Economists believe that (the saving of) physical capital is subject to diminishing returns, so the more you have, the less benefit you get from saving more This property is also known as the diminishing marginal product of capital | Graph: | . | In the long run, a higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income but no to higher growth in those areas According to economic studies, the increased growth from a higher saving rate can last for decades | . | The presence of diminishing returns leads to the catch-up effect where smaller countries can grow at a faster rate than more established ones For example, the US and South Korea both had the same saving rate in 1960, but South Korea grew by a lot more due to its smaller size | . | Though the catch-up effect leads to more rapid growth, bigger countries will remain bigger because they had more capital to start with | . Investment from Abroad . Two types of foreign investment Foreign direct investment occurs when a capital investment is owned and operated by a foreign entity ex: Ford Motor Company creates a new factory in Mexico | . | Foreign portfolio investment occurs when a capital investment is owned by a foreign entity but operated by domestic residents ex: said factory is run by Mexicans | . | Both types increase the stock of capital in Mexico | . | Foreign investments happen because investors expect a return on their money, so the profit made from a domestic factory might be split between foreign investors and residents Still, these investments increase the GDP of the country the factory is in | The GDP measures production and income while the GNP measures only income, so the GDP will increase by more than the GNP due to the cut investors take | . | Investment from abroad is beneficial because it increases productivity and allows poorer countries to understand better technologies | The World Bank encourages investment from abroad into underdeveloped countries to promote stability | . Education . Schooling can increase one’s wages and standard of living considerably, so government policy encouraging schooling can increase the standard of living | Education incurs an opportunity cost; students could have used the time spent in school working in the work force | Some economists argue that human capital is especially important because it confers positive externalities such as the production of new technologies | Poorer countries face the issue of brain drain, or the common practice of educated workers emigrating to richer ones for better wages and a higher standard of living Said workers might not come back to their countries of origin to improve its GDP | . | . Health and Nutrition . Human capital can also refer to public health | Healthier workers are more productive compared to undernourished ones For instance, height has been correlated with higher productivity, and nutrition is a direct cause of height | . | The link between health and wealth creates a vicious cycle; poorer nations have lower productivity and thus less healthy workers which leads to lower productivity The opposite also occurs; wealthier nations have higher productivity and thus healthier workers which leads to higher productivity | . | . Property Rights and Political Stability . Production relies on the interactions between millions of individuals and firms, and the economy must coordinate said interactions through market prices | For pricing to work, economies must have a system of property righs which encourage trade and leads to set prices If property rights don’t exist, then everyone would steal, thus the justice system enforces laws and contracts | . | Underdeveloped countries often lack the ability to enforce property rights, leading to fraud, corruption, and crime Political instability threatens the existence of property rights, as it is unclear whether or not said rights can be enforced | . | Politically stable countries with good governments thus have higher productivity | . Free Trade . Some countries try to use inward-oriented policies which attempt to increase productivity through a lack of interaction with foreign countries Supporters of said policies advance the infant-industry argument and are often distrusting of foreigners | . | Most economists believe that poorer countries are better off using outward-oriented policies which can act as a sort of technology If a country has an abundance of wheat and can trade that wheat for computers, they effectively have technology which turns wheat into computers | Countries that encourage free trade thus experience a high rate of growth equivalent to a technological advance | . | Countries with inward-oriented policies must produce everything (food, textiles, technology, etc) by itself, leading to inefficiency | Countries with seaports and easy access to trade often prosper more than countries without them | . Research and Development . Advances in technological knowledge is a big reason why the quality of life today is better than ever | Technological advances often come from private firms, but said advances are, to a large extent, a public good that can be used by many people | Because of this, the US government encourages the research and spread of new technologies, as seen in programs such as NASA | The patent system encourages research and development for financial gain | . Population Growth . The effects of population growth have been long debated Larger populations lead to more production because of the increased amount of labor | Larger populations lead to higher consumption which can decrease the standard of living at large | . | Population growth also affects factors of production in other ways | Stretching Natural Resources Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outpace the production of food, thus leading to “misery and vice” | Malthus’ theory was incorrect largely due to his failure to account for technological advances in food production | . | Diluting the Capital Stock Some theorize that high population growth reduces the GDP per worker because more workers causes capital, both physical and human, to be spread more thinly | This is most prevalent in poorer countries where the population growth is 3% compared to 1% in developed countries like the US Some countries, like China, forced population growth down through their one-child policy | . | Income equality can encourage population growth to decrease due to the increased opportunity cost of bearing a child | . | Promoting Technological Progress The more people there are, the more geniuses, engineers, scientists, etc. there are to help improve technology This theory has been supported by articles and studies in the past | Larger populations grow at a faster rate due to the discovery of technological advancements | . | . | .",

Consumer price index (CPI): The measure of the overall cost of goods and services bought by a typical consumer | . How The CPI Is Calculated . The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses a few steps to calculate the CPI Fix the basket | The prices most important to the typical consumer are taken into account | Goods and services that are purchased more are given a greater weight when calculating the CPI | Important goods and services found through surveys Find the prices | | Find the prices of the baskets’ goods and services at each point in time that you want to caluclate Computer the basket’s cost | | Use the data on the prices and multiply each price by the good/service’s weight Choose a base year and compute the index | | After choosing a base year, you can calculate the CPI by comparing the price of a basket from the current year to the base year | ∣CPI=Price of basket of goods and services in current yearPrice of basket in base year∗100∣| { text{CPI} = { text{Price of basket of goods and services in current year} over text{Price of basket in base year}} * 100 } |∣CPI=Price of basket in base yearPrice of basket of goods and services in current year​∗100∣ Computer the inflation rate | | Can use the CPI to calculate the inflation rate from year to year | ∣Inflation rate in year 2=CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1CPI in year 1∗100∣| { text{Inflation rate in year 2} = { text{CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1} over text{CPI in year 1}} * 100 } |∣Inflation rate in year 2=CPI in year 1CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1​∗100∣ | . | Example of following the steps: | The CPI is useful to find the cost of living for the average consumer | The core CPI is similar to the CPI except it excludes food and energy, as they have higher volatility | The producer price index (PPI) measures the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by producers rather than consumers Changes in PPI are often thought to be useful to predict changes in CPI | . | . Problems in Measureing the Cost of Living . There are many issues with the CPI that are difficult to solve | Substitution Bias Some prices might rise higher than others, and if said prices become too high, then consumers will substitute those expensive goods and services with cheaper ones | Because the goods and services are substituted, the goods and services in the basket change weight drastically, but the base year always uses a fixed basket, so the CPI might not reflect these new changes | . | Introduction of New Goods If a new good is introduced, then the buying power of a dollar increases | Since the basket is fixed to a base year, the new product that is introduced is not included in the basket, and the CPI does not accurately reflect the new change | . | Unmeasured Quality Change A good or service can increase or decrease in quality without the price of it changing | Quality is hard to measure and thus cannot be accurately reflected in the CPI | . | The accuracy is extremely important for the government; services such as Social Security give out money based on the CPI Economists argue on how to balance it to make it more accurate | . | . The GDP Deflator versus the Consumer Price Index . The GDP deflator and the CPI both reflect changes in prices, but there are two key differences between them The GDP deflator reflects the prices of all goods and services produced domestically while the CPI reflects the prices of all goods and services purchased by consumers For instance, if the price of oil increases, then the CPI will rise much more than the GDP deflator | . | The weighting of the GDP deflator and the CPI differs The CPI does not change the goods and services in its fixed basket, but the GDP deflator measures all currently produced goods and services so it changes more often | . | . | . 24-2: Correcting Economic Variables for the Effects of Inflation . Dollar Figures from Different Times . You can calculate the value of a dollar using the following formula Amount in today’s dollars=Amount in year T dollars∗Price level todayPrice level in year T{ text{Amount in today&amp;#x27;s dollars} = text{Amount in year T dollars} * { text{Price level today} over text{Price level in year T}} }Amount in today’s dollars=Amount in year T dollars∗Price level in year TPrice level today​ | . | . Indexation . A price that is corrected to reflect inflation is said to be indexed, and indexation is typically done through a law or a contract | Many laws use indexation, such as Social Security | . Real and Nominal Interest Rates . An interest rate means that your money increases over time, but the purchasing power of said new dollar is effected by inflation | If your money increases through an interest rate, it may have less or more purchasing power if the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate | Two types of interest rates: nominal interest rate, which does not correct for the effects of inflation, and real interest rate, which does Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 23: Measuring a Nation’s Income . Macroeconomics: the study of the economy as a whole; includes factors such as inflation, unemployment, etc. | Microeconomics: the study of how individual firms and households interact with each other in a free market | Following chapters will focus on macroeconomics and statistics that provide information about the well-being of the entire economy | . 23-1: The Economy’s Income and Expenditure . Can judge how a nation (or person) is doing based on the income of the people in that economy | Gross domestic product (GDP) allows economists to measure income; tracks the total income and total expenditure of an economy Note that for an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure | If someone pays $100 for a service, then one party gains $100 and one party spends $100; GDP raises by $100 as a whole | . | The circular flow diagram is a good representation of GDP All of the green arrows in the figure below represent money and, therefore, changes in GDP | Diagram: | . | . 23-2: The Measurement of GDP . Gross domestic product (GDP): the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time Definition has many aspects | . | . “GDP is the market value…“ . The GDP measures market prices to reflect the value of goods sold and purchased | . “…of all…“ . The GDP attempts to measure the market value of every single good sold or purchased in an economy Housing is measured by the rental price of the home or, if the house is not being rented, the estimated rental price of the home | . | The GDP does not measure illegal products, such as drugs, or products manufactured and consumed in homes, such as a backyard tomato garden This can lead to situations where a marriage can lower a GDP if a consumer and producer get married | . | . “…final…“ . Goods can either be intermediate or final Intermediate goods are used in the process of making a final good; think the corn used in making a tortilla | Final goods are the end product of a production process; the tortilla | GDP only measures the value of final, not intermediate goods | . | The GDP does measure intermediate goods if it is added to an inventory for use at a later time Essentially, additions to an inventory add to the GDP, and when those additions are used at a later time, they are subtracted from the GDP | . | . “…goods and services…“ . Both goods (food, books, video games, etc) and services (haircuts, car wash, concerts, etc.) are included in a GDP | . “…produced…“ . GDP only includes goods and services currently produced, not ones produced in the past If a car manufacturer creates a car, the value of that car is added to the GDP | If someone sells an old car to someone else, the valur of that car is not added to the GDP | . | . “…within a country…“ . The GDP measures the production inside of the geographical boundaries of a country, regardless of the citizenship or nationality of the producer | . “…in a given period of time.” . The GDP measures the value of production in an interval of time, which is typically either a financial quarter or year Reporting for a GDP for a quarter is typically multiplied by 4 to represent an “annual rate” | Quarterly GDP data is typically adjusted in order to account for seasonal changes, such as shopping sprees in December | . | With these clarifications, the definition of GDP has multiple layers Theoretically, the GDP should be equal to the gross domestic income (GDI), but the difference in GDP and GDI can be chalked up to a statistical discrepancy | . | . 23-3: The Components of GDP . The GDP can be understood as a sum of four different types of spending | Y = C + I + G + NX Y represents GDP | C represents consumption | I represents investment | G represents government purchases | NX represents net exports | . | . Consumption . Consumption is spending by households (aka citizens/regular people) on goods and services Does not include housing purchases, as those count as an investment | Services include haircuts and medical care, and goods include food, clothing, appliances, etc. | . | . Investment . Investment includes the purchase of goods (known as capital goods) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services | Includes business capital, residential capital, and inventories/stock Business capital: business structures (like factories), equipment, and intellectual property products (software or recipes) | Residential capital: buildings for rent, personal residences | Inventory: components, ingredients, intermediate goods | . | Investment, in this case, does not refer to financial investments such as stocks and bonds; it refers to goods that will be used in the future to create more goods and services | . Government Purchases . Government purchases includes spending on goods and services by all types of governments Includes salaries of government workers and expenditure on public works | Known officially as government consumption expenditure and gross investment but known traditionally as government purchases | . | Social Security benefits or unemployment is not considered part of government purchases; they are instead defined as transfer payments These are not specified as expenditures because no value is being extracted from the production of goods or services; thus, they are not part of the GDP | . | . Net Exports . Net exports = exports - imports | Net refers to the subtraction of imports from exports in order to show the amount exported Selling a domestic product to a foreign buyer increases GDP, while purchasing a foreign product domestically decreases it | . | . 23-4: Real versus Nominal GDP . If total spending rises from year to year, either a) more goods and services were produced or b) the price of goods increased To measure quantity of goods instead of a change in price, economists use real GDP which uses a market price baseline of a set year | . | . A Numerical Example . Example table of an economy which produces hot dogs and hamburgers: | The total expenditure can be simply found by multiplying the current market price by the current quantity of goods sold The production of goods and services valued at current prices is called the nominal GDP | In the table, the nominal GDP for hot dogs and hamburgers continually increases, but this increase can be attributed ot both the increase in price and the increase in production | . | Real GDP removes the issue of price changes by valuing goods and services at a set price based on a previous year Using 2019 as the base year, we can calculate the value of goods and services using the 2019 market price in order to account for any changes in price | For the base year, the real GDP will always equal the nominal GDP | . | Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. | Real GDP is a better measurement of economic well-being because it consistently tracks the level of production between years; real GDP is used to determine economy growth | . The GDP Deflator . The GDP Deflator is calculated as follows: ∣GDPDeflator=NominalGDPRealGDP∗100∣| { GDP Deflator = {Nominal GDP over Real GDP} * 100 } |∣GDPDeflator=RealGDPNominalGDP​∗100∣ | . | This equation allows us to see how the prices of goods and services have changed compared to the base year If the prices remain the same from the base to current year, then the GDP deflator remains constant | If the prices increase or decrease from the base year, then the GDP deflator will also increase or decrease accordingly | . | . 23-5: Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic Well-Being? . GDP tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy, and in most cases, this tells us about the economic well-being of the average person (more expenditure = more money = happier) | Some disagree that GDP is a good measure of economic well-being, as it does not measure any intangibles such as happiness, bravery, creativity, etc. GDP, though not directly connected, can indirectly measure these traits | More GDP = more education, better nutrition, more specialization for a country | . | GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being Production can unnaturally increase (everyone begins working every day of the week), thus increasing GDP but decreasing well-being | Does not include goods and services produced at home, such as a chef’s home-cooked meals, volunteer work, or the work of stay-at-home parents | Does not measure environmental factors, such as pollution | Does not measure distribution of income; a nation with 100 people making $50k has the same GDP as a nation with 1 person making $5 million and 99 people making $0 | . | In general, GDP is a good measure of well-being for most, but not all, purposes | .",

            "content": "Chapter 16: Monopolistic Competition . 16-1: Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition . Monopoly and perfect competition are two extremes; most markets fall in the middle under imperfect competition | An oligopoly is a market with a few sellers that offer relaitively similar products offered by other sellers Oligopolies can be measured using a concentration ratio, or the percent supplied by the four largest firms in a market | Higher concentration ratios = better described as oligopolies | . | Monopolistic competition refers to markets with many firms selling similar but not identical products Contains three main attributes Many sellers - there are many firms selling to the same group of customers | Product differentiation - each firm produces a product that is unique to other firms, so each firm is not a price taker | Free entry and exit - firms can enter and exit the market, so the number of firms adjusts until economic profit equals zero | . | . | Graphic showing the differences between the types of markets: | . 16-2: Competition with Differentiated Products . The Monopolistically Competitive Firm in the Short Run . Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market can be treated like a monopoly; they face downward-sloping demand curves and produce the quantity at which the marginal revenue equals marignal cost | Graphs showing the curves for two monopolitically competitive firms: | . The Long-Run Equilibrium . The situations depicted in the above graphs don’t last long, as firms making a profit encourages new firms to enter while firms taking a loss encourages firms to exit Less firms = higher price and vice versa | . | Firms in the market eventually reach an equilibrium where they are making zero economic profit Graph showing the curves of a long-run monopolistically competitive firm: | Note that the demand curve is tangent to the average total cost curve at the profit-maximizing quantity | . | Monopolistically competitive markets share some traits with monopolies and perfect competition As in a monopoly, price exceeds marginal cost. This is because the profit-maximizing point is when marginal revenue equals marginal cost and the marginal revenue must be lower the price due to the downward-sloping demand curve | As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost due to the free entry and exit of firms | . | . Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition . Graphs showing the differences between a monopolistic competitive and a perfect competitive firm: . | Two main differences: Excess Capacity and Markup . | . Excess Capacity . The slope of the demand curve is negative and the price that monopolistically competitive firms offer is when the demand curve is tangent to the average total cost curve This means that firms produce less than the quantity at the efficient scale, as the efficient scale has a slope of zero | The difference between this lower quantity and the efficient scale quantity is known as the excess capacity, as perfectly competitive firms could produce more and lower the total average cost | Monopolistically competitive firms cannot produce more, as it lowers the price too much | . | . Markup over Marginal Cost . Price is higher than marginal cost because a monopolistically competitive firm has market power, but they don’t make profit because they are operating below their efficient scale | Monopolistically competitive firms want more customers because that means they receive more profit (price is greater than marginal cost) while perfectly competitive firms don’t care (price is equal to marginal cost) | . Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society . One source of inefficiency is the markup; some customers value a good more than the marginal cost but less than its marked up price Hard to fix this issue, as legislation would need to target all firms that create different products | Additionally, if you remove markup, firms are forced to operate at a loss | . | Another source of inefficiency is that the number of firms may be inefficient because the entry of a firm has external effects The product-variety externality: Consumers get consumer surplus because there is more variety in the market | The business-stealing externality: Other firms in the market get a lower market share, thus lowering producer surplus | Based on these externalities and their magnitude, a market may have too many or too few firms | . | Though there are inefficiencies associated with monopolistic competition, they are difficult to fix and improve upon | . 16-3: Advertising . The Debate over Advertising . Critics argue that advertising is more psychological than informational, and advertising impedes competition by exaggerating the differences in products, thus creating a more inelastic demand curve to profit off of | Defenders argue that advertising is a way to provide information to customers, making them more privy to their options It can also enhance competition because new firms can more easily enter and customers are more informed | . | . Advertising as a Signal of Quality . If a firm has a bad product, then they won’t spend money on advertising because consumers won’t repurchase their product after trying it | If a firm has a good product, then they will spend money on advertising because it establishes a customer base who repeatedly purchases their product | Therefore, advertising can serve as a way to show customers which products are good and which are bad | . Brand Names . Some argue that brand names are detrimental because it accentuates unnoticeable differences between products | Defenders argue that brand names provide information about the quality of a product and encourage prestigous companies to maintain the quality of said product | . Chapter 17: Oligopoly . A market with few sellers that sell identical (or similar) products is called an oligolpoly | Because there are few sellers, each firm must use game theory to cooperate and determine how much of a product they should produce | . 17-1: Markets with Only a Few Sellers . A Duopoly Example . Picture a town with two water sellers Both sellers incur no marginal cost to produce another gallon of water, and the demand curve of water is downward-sloping | . | The demand schedule of water for the town: | . Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels . Let’s suppose that the sellers are in a perfectly copmetitive market The price would equal the marginal cost, so the price would be zero because the marginal cost is zero | The equilibrium quantity would be 120 gallons | . | Let’s suppose that a monopoly owns the water The highest profit is when the monopoly sells 60 gallons of water at $60 each | This result is inefficient because the monopoly produces below the efficient quantity of water | . | The best decision for the duopolists is to produce at the profit maximizing quantity If the sellers agree to sell 30 gallons each, this agreement is called collusion and the sellers working together are called a cartel | Cartels essentially act as monopolies | . | . The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly . Oligopolists would like to act as a cartel, but self-interest often overrides and lowers profit | Assuming that the two water sellers start at the profit maximizing quantity, one water seller might be inclined to sell more water in order to increase their profit Currently, each makes $1,800, but if one seller increases production to 40 gallons, then the price falls to $50, thus netting a profit of $2,000 | . | If both sellers think this way, then the total quantity of water would be 80 gallons and the price of water would be $40 | The sellers would refuse to sell more because they lose profit instead Raising production to 50 gallons lowers the price to $30, meaning that the new profit is $1,500 instead of $1,600 | . | The outcome of 40 gallons is called the Nash equilibrium, or the point at which both firms choose the best strategy based on actions and strategies of the other firm | Self-interest means that firms produce more than a monopoly would but less than perfectly competitive firms would | To summarize: when firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize profit, they produce a quantity of output greater than the level produced by monopoly and less than the level produced under perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly price but greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal cost). | . How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects the Market Outcome . Assume that the two water sellers grows to four, and each seller must decide on a new quantity to produce | The decision made will be based on two effects The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling another gallon of water at the current price will increase profit | The price effect: Raising production increases the quantity sold and lowers the price of water | . | The oligopolists will continue/stop producing water until the price effect and output effect balance each other out, unable to affect the other firms’ production | The more firms in the market, the less of an impact a firm can have on the market price Thus, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows, the more perfectly competitive the market becomes. The price approaches marginal cost, and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level. | . | . 17-2: The Economics of Cooperation . The Prisoners’ Dilemma . Two convicts are given the option to either confess or stay silent Payoff matrix showing the different outcomes based on confessing or staying silent: | . | Regardless of the actions of the other person, the convict should always confess, as confessing will always net them a benefit (20 years vs. 8 years and 1 year vs. 0 years) This strategy is a dominant strategy because it is the best strategy regardless of the actions of the other player | . | Both prisoners thus confess, resulting in a Nash equilibrium where they both spend 8 years in prison Worse than the optimal solution, but better than the worst case scenario | . | . Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma . A payoff matrix can also be drawn for the situation of the water sellers: | Suppose that both firms decide on a starting point of 30 gallons and have the option to either stay at 30 gallons or increase to 40 gallons The situation resembles the Prisoners’ Dilemma: the dominant strategy is to raise production to 40 gallons, as it always increases profit regardless of the actions of the other firm | . | . Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma . Arms Races - The US and USSR both decided to stockpile weapons because it was the dominant strategy Payoff matrix: | . | Common Resources - Two oil companies should build more drills on shared land because it ensures the most amount of profit Payoff matrix: | . | . The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare of Society . The equilibrium derived from the Prisoners’ Dilemma can be detrimental to society The arms race caused both countries to be in danger while the abundance of drills produced less oil in the long run | . | Oligopolists’ lack of cooperation in maintaining monopoly-level production is a good thing, as it means that the quantity produced is closer to the socially efficient outcome | . Why People Sometimes Cooperate . The prisoners’ dilemma situation can be won if the game is repeated over and over again Suppose that the two water sellers can set their production every week | If they only could set it once, then they would both produce 40 gallons, as it is the dominant strategy | If they repeated the situation over weeks, then they would realize that producing 30 gallons is more profitable and agree to doing so This requires a caveat; if the agreement is broken, then the other firm will retaliate by producing 40 gallons | . | $1,800 &gt; $1,500, so in the long run, the firms will reach an agreement and maximize profits | . | . 17-3: Public Policy toward Oligopolies . Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws . Though contracts are typically good for an economy, a contract between competitors that makes a market less competitive has been outlawed over centuries Take the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts which prohibit the “restraint of trade” that increases profits for firms | The Justice Department and private parties can sue and enforce these antitrust laws to prevent firms from making markets less competitive | . | . Controversies over Antitrust Policy . The actions that antitrust policies can prohibit have been debated | . Resale Price Maintenance . A firm that sells a price to stores at $50 and forces them to sell it at $75 is engaging in resale price maintenance | Theoretically, it reduces competition because the price cannot be lowered | Defenders state that resale price maintenance isn’t meant to reduce competition, as the original firm would instead reduce the wholesale price instead of the selling price if it wanted to be more powerful | Additionally, the markup in cost might have a legitimate goal; sellers might be required to have a showroom highlighting the quality of the firm’s product that is paid for by the markup | This scenario highlights that business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate purposes | . Predatory Pricing . A big firm might try to force a smaller firm out by cutting its prices and incurring a loss to protect its market share | Thought it could reduce competition, the big firm must lose money and produce more product at the new price (because a lower price causes a higher demand) This could thus hurt the bigger firm more than the samller firm | . | Hard to tell when a price cut is competitive and when a price cut is predatory | . Tying . A firm might try to sell two products together at a single price, an action called tying | The Supreme Court banned the practice on the grounds that firms could exert more market power by selling more of its product (some of which might be undesirable) | Economists argue that this argument is untrue; if consumers are willing to pay a high price for one product and lower price for the other, then the practice of tying means that the single price must be close to the price of the higher quality product anyways | Tying could act as a form of price discrimination; if two consumers value the two products differently but have a similar willingness to pay for both of them, then firms could tie the products to maximize profit | .",

            "content": "Chapter 15: Monopoly . 15-1: Why Monopolies Arise . Monopoly: A firm that is the sole seller of its product which has no close substitutes Caused by a barrier to entry; other firms cannot enter the market and compete | Three main barriers to entry: monopoly resources, government regulation, and production process | . | . Monopoly Resources . A monopoly can arise if a firm has sole access to a key resource For example, a small town might only have one well; the owner of said well has a monopoly | Famous example is DeBeers, a diamond company that controls 80% of diamonds produced | . | Monopolies rarely arise because of access to a key resource, as most resources are freely available | . Government-Created Monopolies . Monopolies can arise when the government provides one person or firm the sole ability to sell a product The two most important ways the government does so is through patent and copyright laws | . | Though the laws create a monopoly which is undesirable compared to a competitive market, they also encourage research and development | . Natural Monopolies . A natural monopoly occurs when a single firm can supply a good or service at a lower cost than two (or more) other firms combined Naturally monopolistic companies have constant economies of scale | . | Industries with natural monopolies are hard to enter; new firms cannot produce at as low of a price and compete | Smaller markets are more condusive to natural monopolies, as the profit from competing with existing firms has a lower potential | . 15-2: How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions . Monopoly versus Competition . The key difference between competitive firms and monopolies is that monopolies can control the price of the output while competitives firms (price takers) cannot The demand curve for a competitive firm is elastic, as they can produce any quantity and have people buy at that price | The demand curve for a monopoly slopes downward, as higher quantities induce lower prices and vice versa | Figure: | . | . A Monopoly’s Revenue . Consider a water producer with the following statistics: Note that the marginal revenue is always less than the price of the good This is because monopolists lose money on earlier sales while gaining revenue at the new price | When you go from a quantity of 3 to 4, your price drops by a dollar; you lose $3 on the original quantity while increasing revenue by the price * one unit | . | . | When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two effects on total revenue (P x Q): The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher and the total revenue increases | The price effect: The price is lower, so P is lower and the total revenue decreases | . | Marginal revenue is positive when the output effect outweighs the price effect but is negative when the price effect outweighs the output effect | Graph of Demand Marginal Revenue Curves: | . Profit Maximization . Graph of relevant curves for a monopoly: . Similar to competitive firms, monopolies choose the level of production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost Low quantity = lower marginal cost = increase quantity produced | High quantity = high marginal cost = decrease quantity produced | . | Unlike competitive firms, the marginal revenue is always lower than the price Competitive firms: P = MR = MC | Monopolies: P &gt; MR = MC | . | Therefore, to choose the price of the product, monopolies create the quantity at which MR = MC and determine the price using the demand curve | Because the price is greater than the marginal cost for monopolies, a social cost is created | . A Monopoly’s Profit . Similar to competitive firms: Profit (P) = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC) | P = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q | P = (Price - ATC) * Q | . | Graph that shows a monopoly’s profit: | . Main Steps to Maximize a Monopoly’s Profit . Derive the MR curve using the demand curve | Find the quantity at which MR = MC | On the demand curve, find the price that matches the quantity | If the price is greater than the average total cost, the monopoly profits | 15-3: The Welfare Cost of Monopolies . The Deadweight Loss . The quantity the maximizes total surplus is the found at the intersection of the supply curve (or marginal cost curve) and the demand curve Figure: | . | The quantity that the monopolist chooses is the one that maximizes profit which is at the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost Recall that marginal revenue is always lower than price (or demand) | Thus, monopolies produce lower than the efficient quantity. | This causes a deadweight loss because some consumers might value the price above the monopoly’s cost but below its price | Graph: | . | The deadweight loss caused by monopolies is similar to a tax; it drives a wedge between supply and demand Instead of creating revenue for the government, it creates revenue for the monopoly | . | . The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost? . The fact that the firm profits does not mean that there is a social cost; it simply means that producers benefit more than consumers However, because monopolies produce less than is efficient, there is a social cost | . | There is a caveat to this: if monopolies use their profits to maintain their monopoly, then all producer surplus is lost and the deadweight loss grows bigger | . 15-4: Price Discrimination . Price discrimination: Selling the same good at different prices to different customers | . A Parable about Pricing . If one party values a good more than another party, then a monopoly would want to try to sell their product at a higher price to the party that values it more This eliminates deadweight loss, as parties unwilling to buy a good at a higher price will buy the good at a lower one | Increasing the amount sold is equivalent to increasing the quantity; the inefficiency of monopolies is lessened because they produce more | . | . The Moral of the Story . Price discrimination is a rational decision to maximize profit | To price discriminate, firms must be able to separate customers by their willingness to pay (either by geography, method of buying, etc.) Adding on to this, there must be some measure in place to prevent arbitrage, or buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another at a higher price | . | Price discrimination can raise economic welfare, as more consumers purchase the product Note that all increases in surplus are producer-side; they make more profit while consumers purchase goods at their willingness to buy (resulting in zero consumer surplus) | . | . The Analytics of Price Discrimination . Perfect price discrimination is when a monopolist knows each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge them accordingly Assuming the monopolist can perfectly price discriminate, the following graphs can be made: | . | All marginal consumers get the product at their value, and the monopoly pockets all surplus | Imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or not affect the total surplus in a market All that is certain is that price discrimination increases the monopoly’s profit, as firms would only price discriminate if there was a benefit | . | . Examples of Price Discrimination . Movie Tickets - Though the marginal cost of selling a theater seat is constant, there are discounts for kids and seniors | Airline Prices - Depending on the timing of your flight, you might be charged more because you are a businessperson and value a flight more | Discount Coupons - Richer people won’t use coupons and stores can make a bigger profit off of them because of that | Financial Aid - Wealthy families have a higher willingness to pay and thus don’t receive aid so the college can make the most money | Quantity Discounts - The more of a good you purchase, the lower your marginal willingness to pay is, so stores sell in bulk | . 15-5: Public Policy Towards Monopolies . Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws . If two big companies wish to merge, then the Department of Justice analyzes the deal before approving, as the union of two big companies could result in a monopoly Horizontal merges are typically blocked, as they remove all competition | Vertical merges are allowed because it doesn’t remove competition; it just makes one firm more efficient | . | Laws such as the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts allow the government to prevent mergers | Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, but mergers can also create more efficient methods of production It’s up to the government to decide if a merger is beneficial or not, and critics question the government’s decisionmaking abilities | . | . Regulation . Governments regulate the behaviors (typically through pricing) of monopolies, usually focusing on natural monopolies like water or electricity | The price the government sets is difficult to determine A low price could cause the firm to incur a loss, forcing them to exit the industry | A high price (that results in zero economic profit) might not be the profit maximizing quantity for a firm, causing a deadweight loss | . | A regulated price also gives the monopolist no incentive to lower their costs, as they can’t make a higher profit | . Public Ownership . Governments have the option to run a natural monopoly itself Common in European countries where the government owns telephone, water, and electric companies | The US runs the Postal Service | . | Private monopolies are preferred to public monopolies, as private ones have an incentive to lower costs and become more efficient while public ones are slowed by the bureaucracy | . Doing Nothing . Policies aimed at reducing monopolies have drawbacks, and some economists argue that it is most efficient to allow monopolies to flourish | . Summarizing Graphic . .",

            "content": "Chapter 14: Firms in Competitive Markets . 14-1: What is a Competitive Market? . The Meaning of Competition . Competitive markets (aka perfectly competitive markets) have two characterstics There are many buyers and sellers | The goods offered by different sellers are mostly the same | Anonther, optional, condition is thought to characterize competitive markets: a firm can freely enter or exit the market | . | . The Revenue of a Competitive Firm . Suppose there is a dairy farm that produces Q quantity of milk at P price Total revenue = P x Q | Since the farm is small as an individual firm, the price doesn’t change as more dairy is produced | . | Table representing profits at different quantities: The average revenue is the revenue divided by the amount of output, which represents the price For all types of firms, average revenue equals the price of the good. | . | The marginal revenue is the change in revenue for each additional unit of output, which also represents the price because the price is fixed For competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good. | . | . | . 14-2 Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm’s Supply Curve . A Simple Example of Profit Maximization . The following table represents different profits at different quantities: The dairy farm wants to choose the quantity which makes the most profit (revenue - total cost) which would be 4 or 5 gallons of milk | Can also analyze when the marginal revenue is no longer greater than or equal to the marginal cost (Does it cost more to make a gallon of milk than the revenue we’d make? Is the revenue from the gallon of milk greater than its cost?) | . | . The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm’s Supply Decision . Take into account the curves from last chapter which represented marginal cost, average total cost, average variable cost, and more: Remember that the price is the same as average and marginal revenue (AR and MR) | At Q1, the marginal cost is less than the marginal revenue, so the firm should produce more in order to realize a greater profit | At Q2, the marginal cost is greater than the marginal revenue, so the firm should produce less in order to prevent losses | . | This analysis provides three rules for maximizing profit If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its output. | If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its output. | At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue equals marginal cost. | . | If the price were to rise, then the firm would produce a higher quantity in order to make more profit, and if the price were to fall, then the price would produce less The marginal cost curve therefore determines the quantity of good that a firm is willing to produce at any given price; similar to a supply surve with an elastic demand | . | . The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down . A shutdown is the decision to seize production during a period of time due to market conditions, while an exit refers to a long-term decision to leave a market Shut down firms still have to pay fixed costs while exiting firms don’t have to pay any costs at all | Some of these costs can be opportunity costs; if a farmer doesn’t plant crops on his land, then the land is doing nothing and becomes a sunk cost If he instead decides to sell the land, then he exits the market and does not pay this sunk cost | . | . | A firm will shut down if its total revenue would be less than any of its variable costs of production Represented by TR (Total Revenue) &lt; VC (Variable Costs) | Can be rewritten as TR/Q &lt; VC/Q | Remember that TR/Q = P (Price) and VC/Q = AVC (Average Variable Costs) | Therefore, a firm should shut down if P &lt; AVC | . | Visual Representation: | . Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs . A sunk cost is a cost that has been committed and cannot be recovered; should not be included when making decisions | When deciding whether or not a firm should shut down, we must assume that the firm’s fixed costs are sunk in the short run and should be ignored when making a decision | Relates to the adage “don’t cry over spilt milk”; can’t do anything about a sunk cost | . The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market . Exiting a market means that you save both variable and fixed costs of production, so a firm exists a market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than the total costs of production Represented by TR &lt; TC (Total Cost) | Can be rewritten as TR/Q &lt; TC/Q | TC/Q = Average Total Cost | Therefore, a firm should exit if P &lt; ATC | Additionally, a firm should enter if P &gt; ATC | . | Visual Representation: | . Measuring Profit in Our Graph for the Competitive Firm . Recall that Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost Can be rewritten as Profit = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q | Profit = (P - ATC) * Q | . | This way of looking at profit allows us to measure profit in the graphs: | . A Brief Recap . . 14-3: The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market . In the short run, it’s unreasonable to assume that firms can easily enter or exit a market, but in the long run they can, so the number of firms will adjust accordingly | . The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed Number of Firms . Consider a market with 1,000 identical firms; each has the same marginal cost curve, so the amount supplied will change depending on the price’s position on the curve Graphs: | . | . The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit . Assume that everyone has access to the same technology for producing a good and access to the same markets to buy the inputs for production In this scenario, all current and future firms have the same cost curves | . | If the firms in a market are profitable, then more firms will enter the market and decrease prices and profits | If the firms in a market are losing money, then firms will exist the market and increase prices and profits | These two forces will balance out, and firms that remain in the market will make zero economic profit | Recall that Profit = (P - ATC) * Q Since all firms are making zero economic profit, the price and average total cost must be driven to equality over time | . | Firms maximize profit by choosing a quantity where their marginal cost is equal to the price, and the force of entry and exit ends when average total cost is equal to price Thus, marginal cost and average total cost must equal each other which is where the average total cost is at its lowest This point is called a firm’s efficient scale | . | Therefore, in the long-run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at their efficient scale | . | Graph: | In the long run, the only price consistent with zero profit is the minimum of average total cost, and all firms must be price takers at this price, creating an elastic supply curve | . Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business If They Make Zero Profit? . Recall that total costs include both implicit and explicit costs Implicit costs are not seen in cash; they are opportunity costs | If the opportunity cost of the capital to create a farm is $80k/year of interest, then that might be the profit a farmer makes each year, leading to zero economic profit | . | . A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run . Let’s say that a new scientific study increases the demand for milk The price becomes higher than the minimum ATC, and firms realize a short term profit | . | As the market becomes more profitable, more firms enter, driving down the price and profits of milk | As more firms enter, the price goes back down to the minimum ATC, but the quantity produced and consumed of milk is higher than before | Figure: | . Why the Long-Run Supply Curve Might Slope Upward . There are two reasons why the long-run market supply curve might slope upwards instead of being perfectly elastic The resources used in production are available only in limited quantities There is limited land that you can purchase for farming, and as more farms are created, the price of land goes up as well | This means that the input cost of farms goes up, leading to an increase in price and an upwards slope | . | Firms might have different costs Consider the painting market, where different painters are skilled | Newcomers have a higher cost because they are less skilled, and if the quantity demanded of painters increase, then the price needs to increase as well to make these newcomer firms profitable | Low cost firms make more of a profit, creating an upwards sloping supply curve | . | . | In both scenarios, some firms profit even in the long run because the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the marginal firm (new firms who would exit quickly if the price was lower) | Despite these factors, for the most part, because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve. | .",

A matrix is a 2d array with rows and columns; each element in a matrix is called an entry and each entry can be denoted by i, j where i is the row and j is the column A matrix is a square matrix if the number of rows and columns are the same | . | An adjacency matrix can be created for a directed graph with n vertices; the matrix will have n rows and columns, and each entry will either be 1 or 0 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j | You can apply mathematical operations onto a matrix A Boolean matrix is a matrix whose entries only contain elements from {0, 1}, and you can use Boolean addition/multiplication/whatever on entries of a Boolean matrix | The product of two matrices, A and B, is well defined if the number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B | To find A x B, take the dot product of a row of A and a column of B If A and B are n x n matrices, then the dot product is represented by the following equation: Ai, 1B1, j + Ai, 2B2, j + … + Ai, nBn, j | Illustration: | . | A matrix product, or AB, is found by taking the dot product of row i of matrix A and column j of matrix B Example: | Continue the process throughout the matrix: | . | . | The kth power of a matrix is the product of k copies of A Ak = A * A * … * A, k times | . | Can take the power of a matrix and apply it to the power of a directed graph Take a graph, G, and create an adjency matrix (A) for it | Compute Ak | Ak is the adjacency matrix for Gk | . | The matrix sum of two matricies with the same number of rows and columns is calculated by adding each entry and calculating the resulting matrix Example: | The matrix sum can be used to find the graph union between two graphs Example: | . | The transitive closure of a directed graph can be found by adding a matrix’s powers up to its number of vertices Equations: | . | . | . 6.7: Partial orders . A partial order must satisfy three conditions Transitive | Reflexive | Anti-Symmetric | . | Example: | Partial orders are similar to &lt;= in the sense that certain elements can be “less than” another element by being the the tail of an edge | Two elements are comparable if they have an edge between them and incomparable if not To represent the relation, a ⪯ b is used instead of aRb (note the curved part of the &lt; sign) | A partial order is a total order if all elements are comparable with each other | . | A minimal element is one with no elements pointing into it, while a maximal element is one with no edges pointing out of it | A Hasse diagram represents a partial order on a finite domain Drawn by putting lower elements below higher ones | Example: | . | . 6.8: Strict orders and directed acyclic graphs . A strict order is similar to a partial order, must satisfy two conditions Transitive | Anti-Reflexive | Based on the above two properties, a strict order is also anti-symmetric | . | Example: . | Strict orders are analagous to &lt; because you cannot be “equal” to yourself (anti-reflexive) | Strict orders are closely related to directed acyclic graphs (DAG) which are directed graphs with no cycles A directed graph, G, has no cycles if and only if G+ is a strict order | . | A topological sort is taken by starting with the minimal element(s), putting them into a list, and then removing them from the graph to get the new minimal element(s) | . 6.9: Equivalence relations . An equivalence relation (represented by a ~) must satisfy three conditions Transitive | Reflexive | Symmetric | . | Example: | An equivalence class is a subset of the domain that that contains a certain kind of element Represented by [a] where a represents the properties of that class | Example: | Two different equivalence classes can either be identical or completely disjoint | . | A partition of set A is a set of non-empty subsets of A that are pairwise disjoint and whose union is A The union of all equivalence classes will create a partition | . | . 6.10: N-ary relations and relational databases .

A binary relation between two sets A and B is denoted as a subset R of A x B Binary because it is a Cartesian product of two sets | For a ∈ A and b ∈ B, the fact that (a, b) ∈ R is denoted by aRb. | For example, take a school with a set of students (S) and a set of classes (C); a given student is taking a certain class if sEc | . | Relations can be defined on infinite sets using formulas Example: xCy if x + y = 2 | . | If two sets are finite, then a binary relation between them can be represented by a list of irdered pairs or in an arrow diagram Arrow diagram: | . | A matrix representation of a binary relation can be shown using a 2D array of numbers with |A| rows and |B| columns If aRb, then the given square is 1; otherwise, it’s 0 | Example: | . | Can use a binary relation on two sets which are the same; called a binary relation on a set The set is called the domain of the binary relation | . | In an arrow diagram for a binary relation on a set, if an element maps to itself, it can be represented via a self-loop Example: | . | . 6.2 Properties of binary relations . A binary relation on set is reflexive if and only if, for every x in the set, xRx | A binary relation on set is anti-reflexive if and only if, for every x in the set, it is not true that xRx Both properties are universal statements, so to show one or the other, you must show that xRx is true/false for one element | If some of the elements are related to themselves and some are not, then the relation is neither reflexive nor anti-reflexive | . | A relation on set is symmetric if and only if, for every pair x,y, xRy if and only if yRx In other words, xRy and yRx are both true or neither xRy and yRx are true | . | A relation on set is anti-symmetric if and only if, for every pair x, y, xRy and yRx are not both true In other words, these three conditions are met: xRy, but it is not true that yRx | yRx, but it is not true that xRy | Neither xRy nor yRx is true | . | . | A relationship is transitive if and only if, for every three elements x, y, z, if xRy and yRz then xRz | Example on how to prove (or disprove) properties: | . 6.3 Directed graphs, paths, and cycles . A directed graph (digraph) is a way to visualize relations, represented by (V, E) Consists of a set of vertices, V, and a set of directed edges, E, which is a subset of V x V | One element of V is a vertex, and an edge (u, v) connects two vertices, with the tail vertex being represented by u and the head vertex being represented by v | If the head and tail are the same, then the edge is a self-loop | The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing into it (how many times it’s the head) while the out-degree is the number of edges pointing out of it (how many times it’s the tail) | . | A walk in a directed graph is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges that is used to visualize paths between vertices Takes the form of (v0, (v0, v1), v1, (v1, v2), v2, …) | If there are two consecutive vertices, then the edge between those vertices is assumed to exist | The length of a walk is the number of edges | A closed walk is one where the first and last vertices are the same; an open one is one where they are not | . | A trail is an open walk in which no edge occurs more than once | A path is a trail in which no vertex occurs more than once | A circuit is a closed walk in which no edge occurs more than once | A cycle is a circuit of length at least 1 in which no vertex occurs more than once, except the first and last vertices which are the same | . 6.4 Composition of relations . Can combine two relations using a composition, which is denoted S o R A pair (a, c) ∈ S o R if and only if there exists b such that (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ S | Visual representation: | . | . 6.5 Graph powers and the transitive closure . A relation on set can be composed with itself: R o R | A composition of the same relation on set repeated can be represented in power notation R1 = R | Rk = R o Rk-1, for all k &gt;= 2 | . | In an edgeset, Ek is the relation E composed with itself k times, and Gk is the graph whose edgeset is Ek The k is denoted as the power of G | . | The Graph Power Theorem: Let G be a directed graph. Let u and v be any two vertices in G. There is an edge from u to v in Gk if and only if there is a walk of length k from u to v in G. | Visual Example: | The union of Gk represents the reachability of vertices by walks of any positive length in G If the number of vertices is finite, then you need to only add up to the power of |V| | . | A relation R follows the same structure Let R be a relation on a finite domain with n elements; R+ = R1 u R2 u R3 u … u Rn | R+ is known as the transitive closure of R Any relation that contains all pairs from R and is transitive must include all the pairs in R+ | . | Accordingly, G+ is the transitive closure of G | . | Graphical Example: | You can also find a transitive closure using the following method: Repeat until no pairs can be added to R: | If there are three elements x, y, z ∈ A such that (x, y) ∈ R, (y, z) ∈ R and (x, z) ∉ R, then add (x, z) to R | . | . .",

            "content": "Chapter 13: The Costs of Production . 13-1: What Are Costs? . Consider a cookie factory. It must buy ingredients for the cookies, machines to make them, and workers to run the machines. Then, she sells the cookies to customers. . Total revenue, Total Cost, and Profit . Must make the assumption that the goal of a firm is to make profit | Total Revenue: The amount that the firm receives for the sale of its output (cookies) | Total Cost: The amount that the firm pays as input (ingredients, machinery, workers) | Profit: A firm’s total revenue minus its total cost | The objective is to make the profit as high as possible | . Costs as Opportunity Costs . When considering a firm’s cost of production, the opportunity cost must also come into play | Explicit Cost: Any cost that requires a firm to pay out some amount of money | Implicit Cost: Any cost that can’t/isn’t represented by a monetary price If the factory owner can make $100/hr programming, then each hour she spends working on the factory is “losing” $100 | . | Economists will take into account both the implicit and explicit costs while an accountant will only focus on the explicit cost If programming becomes more profitable than running a factory, than the owner might switch professions; the accountant would fail to recognize this change because the factory is still make a profit on paper | . | . The Cost of Capital as an Opportunity Cost . An implicit cost that most businesses incur is the opportunity cost of the capital used to finance the business If the factory cost $300k to buy, then that’s $300k that isn’t accruing interest or being put into the stock market | . | The accountant will fail to account for this implicit cost because there is no money flowing out of the business, but if it was framed as an interest from a loan that you must pay off, then they would | . Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit . Economic Profit = Total Revenue - All Opportunity Costs (implicit or explicit) | Accounting Profit = Total Revenue - All Explicit Costs | Accounting profit is typically larger than economic profit because of the failure to acknowledge implicit costs, but economic profit is more important for firms because it covers all costs | . 13-2: Production and Costs . Assume that the cookie factory cannot change its size but it can change the number of workers it employs (indicative of the short term rather than the long term) . The Production Function . Consider the following table: The relationship between quantity of input and quantity of output is called the production function | . | Marginal product: The change in the quantity of output from one additional unit of input As seen in the table, the more workers you have, the less the marginal product becomes | This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal product | . | Graphical examples: | . From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve . Columns 4, 5, and 6 in the above table all show the cost of producing cookies | The most important relationship in the table is the one between the quantity produced (column 2) and the total cost (column 6) Shown in the above total-cost curve | . | The production function and total-cost curve have relatively inverse relationships; production function gets flatter at higher quantities while total-cost gets steeper | . 13-3: The Various Measures of Cost . Consider a coffee shop with the following data: . Fixed and Variable Costs . The total cost can be divided into two types Fixed costs do not change with the quantity of output produced; includes rent, building costs, etc. | Variable costs do change with the quantity of output produced; includes ingredients, workers, etc. | . | The total cost is the sum of these two costs | . Average and Marginal Cost . When considering costs, two questions may be asked How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee? | How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup? | . | The cost of a typical unit can be found by dividing the total cost by the quantity of output it produces; known as average total cost (ATC) Can also find the average fixed cost (AFC) and the average variable cost (AVC) by dividing the fixed or variable cost by the quantity of output, respectively | . | Average costs are indicative of the cost of a typical unit, but it does not signify by how much the cost will change as the production changes The marginal cost (MC) shows the change in cost when adding 1 unit of output; shown in column 8 | . | Equations to represent the two costs: | . Lecture Notes . In the short term, the total cost is equal to the hourly wage * labor, as the only thing you can do is add more workers | AVC = (Wages * Labor) / Quantity = Wages / (Quantity / Labor) = Wages / Average Product of Labor (APL) AVC and APL are inverse | . | MC = Wages * deltaLabor / deltaQuantity = Wages / (deltaQuantity / deltaLabor) = Wages / Marginal Product Marginal Cost and Marginal Product are inverse | . | . Cost Curves and Their Shapes . The graphs of ATC, AFC, AVC, and MC all follow different shapes: | Rising Marginal Cost The marginal cost rises as the quantity of output increases due to the property of diminishing marginal product; the more he produces, the more it costs to make 1 more unit | . | U-Shaped Average Total Cost The ATC is the sum of the AFC and AVC | At low quantities, it costs a lot to make a few cups of coffee, as the AFC is very high due to being spread out over a few units | The ATC will decrease until adding more units does not lower the AFC, in which case the AVC takes over and begins increasing the ATC | The bottom of the U-Shape that minimizes the ATC is called the efficient scale of the firm; balanced to yield the lowest average total cost | . | The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising. | This makes sense because, if a marginal cost is higher than the ATC, then it will increase the ATC, while if it is lower than the ATC, then it will decrease the ATC | Due to this relationship, the marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its minimum. The ATC cannot lower any further at this point and must increase | . | . | . Typical Cost Curves . This simplified situation showed the property of diminishing marginal product and rising marginal cost, but in real life, this might not always apply | The following graph best represents the cost curves for a typical firm: | Despite the differences, there are three properties that are important to remember: Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output | The average total cost curve is U-shaped | The intersection of the marginal cost and average total cost curves represents the minimum average total cost | . | . 13-4: Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run . The Relationship between Short-Run and Long-Run Average Total Cost . In the short term, a factory owner cannot immediately create a new factory or new facility to increase production Factories are a fixed cost in the short term but a variable cost in the long term | . | In the long run, a company can afford to hire more workers and factories to reduce the average total cost back down | Graph: | . Economies and Diseconomies of Scale . When the average total cost continues to go down as the output increases, then there is an economy of scale | When the average total cost continues to go up as the output increases, then there is an diseconomy of scale | When the average total cost remains constant as output increases, then there are constant returns to scale | Can be explained by specialization When there are few workers and factories, then the average total cost is high | As you add more workers and factories, the cost goes down further because production becomes more efficient | If you add too many workers, then the gains of specialization have already been realized, and you have to hire less efficient workers | . | .",

Boolean algebra: a set of rules and operations for working with variables with values of 0 or 1; similar to propositional logic Boolean multiplication: Denoted by • and works the same as regular multiplication, logically the same as ∧ Table: | . | Boolean addition: Denoted by + and works the same as regular addition except 1 + 1 = 1, logically the same as ∨ Table: | . | Complement: Denoted by an over bar, works the same as the ¬ operator: 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0 | . | Relates to digital logic which is used to create computers | Variables that have a value of 1 or 0 are called Boolean variables, and Boolean expressions can be created by using Boolean operations on Boolean variables | Rules of precedence for boolean operations: Boolean multiplication takes precedence over Boolean addition. | The complement operation is applied as soon as the entire expression under the bar is evaluated. | Parentheses can be used to override the precedence rules. | . | Two Boolean expressions are equivalent if, for any combination of values of its variables, they have the same value Laws of Boolean algebra: | . | . 5.2: Boolean functions . Boolean functions map multiple Boolean input values to the set {0, 1} Can be represented by an input/output table (similar to a truth table) but is not feasible for larger numbers of inputs, as the outputs are equal to 2k where k = the number of inputs | Can express functions using Boolean expressions | . | Steps to derive a Boolean function via table: Literal: One expression that either equals a variable or a variable’s complement | Must take the minterm (a group of literals that make each variable equal 1) of each row that equals 1 | . | . 5.3: Disjunctive and conjunctive normal form . The disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a Boolean expression that is the sum of products of literals Example: | . | The conjunctive normal form (DNF) is a Boolean expression that is the sum of sums of literals Example: | . | . 5.4: Functional completeness . A set of operations is functionally complete if any Boolean expression can be rewritten using the set {addition, multiplication, complement} is functionally complete | {multiplication, complement} is also functionally complete because addition can be rewritten with multiplication: | {addition, complement} is also functionally complete because multiplication can be rewritten as addition: | . | NAND operation is denoted by ↑ and returns the complement of Boolean multiplication | NOR operation is denoted by ↓ and returns the complement of Boolean addition Tables for NAND and NOR: | . | One way to test functional completeness is to start with a known set and try replacing one of the operations with another | . 5.5: Boolean satisfiability . The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem asks if a Boolean expression can possibly evaluate to 1 If you can set it equal to 1, then it is satisfiable; if not, it is unsatisfiable | A particular set of values satisfies a Boolean expression if it makes it equal to 1 | There is no sufficient, fast method to solve SAT, as you have to check each input | . | If an expression is in DNF form, then it is easy to check if the expression is satisfiable Check if one of the literals does NOT contain a variable and its complement | . | In the CNF form, it is harder to check if the expression is satisfiable; you must check if each of the constraints equals 1 given a set of input values | . 5.6: Gates and circuits . Boolean algebra is used to create circuits an electronic devices A circuit built from electrical devices is called a gate, and a gate receives an input of Boolean values and returns an output | AND gates represent Boolean multiplication, OR gates represent Boolean addition, and the inverter represents the complement | Can combine gates together to create complex functions | . | This class will focus only on combinatorial circuits which do not store variables or loop Combinatorial circuits compute a Boolean function | Finding a Boolean function from a circuit: | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 10: Externalities . Externality: When the actions of one person affects another without paying or receiving compensation If the effect is bad, it is a negative externality, but if it’s good, then it’s a positive externality | Externalities cause the market equiblibrium to become inefficient, especially if buyers and sellers do not take them into account For example, pollution can seriously damage an economy over time, so it’s inefficient to support it | Governments must create laws in order to change the behaviors of those in the market and to dampen the effects of externalities | . | . | . 10-1: Externalities and Market Inefficiency . Welfare Economics: A Recap . The market equilibrium will always adjust to maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus | . Negative Externalities . Suppose the market for steel produces pollution, and for each unit produced, an amount of pollution enters the atmosphere | This externality increases the cost of producing steel as a whole; the social cost equals the cost of pollution to society as a whole plus the cost to the producer | To create a better equilibrium, the entire social cost needs to be taken into account Raising the price of a good (through taxes or otherwise) to better reflect its social cost is called internalizing the externality because it makes buyers and sellers think about the consequences of their decisions | . | . . Positive Externalities . Some activities can bring benefits to third parties, such as education Even if only one person is smarter, society as a whole becomes more intelligent, workers become more specialized, etc. | . | Positive externalities are similar to negative ones in the sense that the total social value of a good may not be realized The government can internalize the externality and incentivize education through subsdizing public schools | . | . . General rule of thumb: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the externality by taxing goods with negative externalities and subsidizing goods with positive externalities. | . 10-2: Public Policies toward Externalities . Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation . Command-and-control policies directly affect consumer behavior Examples include illegalizing the dumping of toxic chemicals into the water supply | . | Most cases of pollution are not as simple, and it is nigh impossible to illegalize all sources of pollution (such as transpotation) | Regulation is difficult and requires much research and deliberation | . Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes and Subsidies . Instead of directly regulating behavior, the government can incentivize their citizens to act a certain way throuh market-based policies For example, they can tax goods with negative externalities and subsidize goods with positive ones | . | Taxes created to deal with negative externalities are called corrective taxes (also called Pigovian taxes) | Corrective taxes are generally preferred to regulations Suppose one market is more effective than another at reducing pollution, and a tax is levied on each unit of pollution produced; the more efficient market is incentivized to reduce pollution by a lot more | The tax places a price on the right to pollute, and it allocates the cost of pollution to factories who produce the most of it | Taxes also provide an incentive to reduce pollution by as much as possible instead of just hitting the required quota | . | Corrective taxes are a much more positive tax than the ones previously discussed | . Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits . Suppose that a regulation of 300 tons of pollution is in place, and a paper and steel mill come to the EPA with a deal The paper mill will reduce its pollution to 200 tons while the steel mill increases its pollution to 400 tons, and the steel mill will play $5 million to the paper mill | This deal creates a new good, pollution permits, and is good for economic efficiency A market to trade permits will emerge, and the right to pollute will be bought by those who value it the most (i.e. those who are unable to efficiently reduce the amount of pollution they produce) | The existence of pollution permits causes the price of pollution to go up; buyers must buy pollution permits, and sellers don’t realize the income from selling a pollution permit if they continue to pollute | . | Both corrective taxes and pollution permits interalize the externality of pollution | . | Graph that shows the effect of both policies: . | In both cases, the EPA determines the price of pollution, either by imposing a price or creating a supply of pollution permits that is perfectly inelastic The choice between corrective taxes and pollution permits boils down to known information If the government knows that the external cost of pollution is $50,000 per unit, then they should tax | If the gogvernment knows how much they want to reduce pollution by, then they should auction off as many pollution permits as would allow the amount to go down | . | . | . Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution . Environmentalists argue that pollution should not be given a fee, as clean water and air are human rights that should not be thought of as monetary | Economists believe that people face trade-offs; clean water and air has a value, but eliminating all pollution is impossible, as it would lead to a lower standard of living A clean environment can be thought of as another good, and it has an income elasticity associated with it as well as a demand/supply curve | . | . 10-3: Private Solutions to Externalities . The Types of Private Solutions . Moral codes and social judgemnts can solve externalities For example, not many people litter because they are taught as children not to | . | Charities can leverage private donations to solve externalities, and schools receive donations/gifts from private parties all the time | Self-interest can internalize the externality Integrating businesses Suppose an apple orchard and bee farm are next to each other; the bees use the apples’ pollen, and the apples are pollinated by the bees, but the two firms don’t plant enough apples/create enough beehives to be completely efficient | Combining the two farms would interalize the externality | . | Creating contracts Creating a contract between the apple grower and beekeepr could specify the number of apple trees/beehives to solve the inefficiency | . | . | . The Coase Theorem . The Coase theorem stipulates that, if private parties can bargain over the allocation of resources, then they can always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently | Suppose that Emily has a dog that barks and disturbs her neighbor, Horace If Horace offers Emily money to get rid of the dog, then they can accurately determine the value of having the dog/getting rid of the dog for each person | If Emily values the dog more than Horace’s offer, then the allocation is efficient; if Horace offers enough money for Emily to get rid of the dog, then the allocation is efficient | . | Suppose that Horace has the legal right to peace and quiet Coase theorem states that the distribution of rights does not matter | Horace can legally compel Emily to get rid of the dog, but Emily can provide a counteroffer of money for Horace to not pursue legal action | The situation is the same; if Emily offers enough money, then Horace won’t get rid of the dog, but if she doesn’t, he will, leaqding to an efficient allocation of resources | . | The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome is efficient. | . Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work . Private parties often fail to resolve the problems of externalities | Transaction costs, or costs that parties incur while bargaining, can hamper the ability to solve an externality problem Suppose that Emily and Horace spoke different languages; the cost of hiring translators might outweigh the value of solving the problem which could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources | . | Bargaining offers can also break down If Horace offers a price below his value to remove the dog and Emily counteroffers a price above her value to keep it, then negotiations could fail | . | Efficient bargains become increasingly difficult when the number of involved parties is large If a factory pollutes a fishing lake, it could be difficult to get all of the local fishermen to make a deal with the factory | . | . Chapter 11: Public Goods and Common Resources . 11-1: The Different Kinds of Goods . There are different kinds of goods; a market for ice cream is easy to make efficient, but a market for clean air is not | Two different characteristics of goods Excludability: How easy it is to prevent someone from using a good; if you can’t prevent someone from using it, then it’s not excludable | Rivalry in consumption: If one person’s use of a good reduces another person’s ability to use it, then it is a rival in consumption (similar to a zero sum game) | . | These two characteristics creates four categories Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption, makes up most of the goods in the economy: you must pay for it to use it, and if you use it, someone else can’t | Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in competition, makes up goods/services that are provided by the government or nature | Common resources are rival in competition but not excludable, makes up goods that anyone has access to | Club goods are excludable but not rival in competition, makes up services that you must pay to use | Table of categories: | The categories can blur based on factors such as population or government control, but they are useful for making generalizations | . | . 11-2: Public Goods . For this section, consider a fireworks display, which is neither excludable nor rival in competition | . The Free-Rider Problem . Say that a town with 500 residents place a 10$ value on watching the fireworks on the 4th of July If the fireworks cost the government $1000, then there is a total surplus of $4000 if there is no fee | The citizens are free riders; they receive the benefit without paying for it | . | A private market would not work, as the citizens of the town would not purchase a ticket to watch fireworks that they could watch for free This results in a market failure | The market failure arises because of an externality; if a private firm put on a firework show, then there are people who can watch it without paying for it, thus causing a third party to gain a benefit without paying Causes economic inefficiency | . | . | The issue can be resolved by levying a tax and then the government using the revenue from said tax to pay a private firm to put on the fireworks | Because public goods are not excludable, the free-rider problem prevents an efficient, private market for them from arising | . Some Important Public Goods . National Defense No one can be excluded from defense after it is set up, and the defense of one person doesn’t detract from the defense of another; neither excludable nor rival in competition | Extremely expensive to provide | . | Basic Research Complicated and specific research can be patented and therefore excluded, but general knowledge cannot; once a theorem is proven, anyone can use it without restricting others’ access to it | Firms spend money on specific research in order to make money, but they do not spend resources on basic research Public policy (in the form of patents) is therefore required in order to incentivize research | Basic research is subsidized as well | . | . | Fighting Poverty The government helps the poor in order to provide equality; doesn’t exclude their services and they try to help as many people as possible | Cannot create a private market for fighting poverty because of the free market problem | . | . The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis . The government must choose which public goods to provide and in how much quantity Must use a cost-benefit analysis in order to determine which goods to provide | Difficult to determine the true value provided by a public good because there is no “price tag” on it; must use approximations | . | . 11-3: Common Resources . The fact that common resources are rival in competition gives way to the Tragedy of the Commons | . The Tragedy of the Commons . Suppose there is a grass field that a medieval town shares to graze sheep When there few sheperds, everyone can use the grass field, but after the population grows, the grass field becomes barren and doesn’t regrow | The reason for the destruction is because social and private incentives don’t mesh; sheperds want to use the field as much as possible, but it’s better for the community if they use it more sparingly | . | The Tragedy of the Commons arises when a common resource is overused and its quality deteriorates as a result | Common resources are often used excessively (because no one wants to be the one who is at a disadvantage for not using it), and the government must regulate or tax it in order to regulate consumption | . Some Important Common Resources . Clean Air and Water Pollution can negatively affect clean air and water because firms take it for granted, and overfishing can also ruin clear water | . | Congested Roads Once a road is congested, its use negatively affects other people’s use of it - it becomes a common resource | One way to prevent road congestion is to add a tax or toll and raise the toll during rush hours | Another way is to add a tax to gasoline which will prevent as many people from driving Not preferred because it can have other effects; it also disincentivizes driving in general | . | . | Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife Many animals are common resources, and most people have little incentive to keep the population up, so overfishing and whaling is a possible issue | Oceans are one of the least regulated common resources, as many countries have access to it and it’s difficult to enforce an agreement | Within nations, governments can more regulate fishing such as through the use of hunting/fishing licenses | . | .",

Lawrence’s book Pornography and Obscenity, Lawrence argues that such stories should be shared in order to have a more open discussion about sex The story is also seen as extremely obscene and misogynistic | . | Boccaccio is offering a parody of the “monk going out to the desert to become spiritually enlightened” trope (Journey to the West) The Life of Maria the Harlot in particular was a very similar story that followed a young girl who lived in the desert as a hermit Maria becomes seduced by a monk after she lives there for 18 years | Maria turns to prostitution because she is ashamed, and her uncle visits her (pretending to be a customer) and tells her that she should not be ashamed | Maria dies a saint in the desert | . | . | Comparisons between Maria and Alibech Maria’s uncle exhibits paternal love and responsibility while Rustico acts as a father figure and seduces/rapes her | Both are seduced by a monk in the desert, but Maria is ashamed while Alibech is not | Maria willingly leaves the city to return to the desert while Alibech is reluctant to leave the desert and go to the city | Maria experiences trauma from her sexual experience while Alibech does not and wears out Rustico instead | . | Boccaccio argues that sex is human behavior and a necessary evil Both Rustico and Alibech fall victim to their sexual desires | Alibech thinks of her sexual experience as a one-time thing while Rustico knows that he is sinning | Rustico acts in bad faith but Alibech does not | Alibech represents innocence | . | Alibech lives in a sinless world; she doesn’t feel guilt because she believes her motives are pure Women tell her that her new husband will help with those motives | Alibech represents a “pure” sexual drive, while Rustico represents a sinful one | . | Rustico’s sins First sin was pride, believed that he could resist the temptations of Alibech’s young body but failed | Second sin was lust, could not recognize the control lust had over him | Alibech commits neither of those sins, and her sexual drive is approved in this story through marriage and bearing children | . | Alibech’s blameless behavior Boccaccio believes that if one has pure intentions, then they will earn God’s grace | . | Keep III.10 in mind while reading IV.1 Boccaccio achieves a comic effect through merging eroticism and asceticism | Alibech’s experience is predicated on her innocence, and she has to face the city and face its social constructs after leaving the desert | How is this similar to what the brigata memebers must do after they leave the palace? | . | . | Brief thoughts on Bocaccio’s “On Poetry” and the defense of figurative thinking Excerpt from a larger work where Bocaccio discusses the family histories of pagan Greco-Roman gods | Boccaccio defends literary writing and poetry which is the main idea of the Decameron | Insists that writing often has “hidden” meanings which is the main benefit of poetry | Boccaccio argues for studying texts and finding deeper meaning; refers to Biblical texts, such as when Jessu spoke in parables | . | .",

Function: Maps elements from one set to another using some sort of operation Can be represented as a set and as a subset of X × Y such that for every x ∈ X, there is exactly one y ∈ Y for which (x, y) ∈ f | f: X -&gt; Y is used to show that f is the function that maps set X to Y | Set X is the domain of the function while set Y is the target or co-domain of the function | “f maps x to y” can be written as (x, y) ∈ f and can also be denoted as f(x) = y | If a function maps an element of the domain to either 0 elements or &gt;1 element, then it is not well-defined | An element is in the range of f if there is an x ∈ X such that (x, y) ∈ f Alternate definition: Range of f = { y: (x, y) ∈ f, for some x ∈ X } | . | . | A function that has a finite domain can be shown graphically as an arrow diagram Example: | Non well-defined function example: | . | A function definition is incomplete without specifying the domain and target Correct: g: R → R, where g(x) = |x| | Incorrect: g(x) = |x| | . | . 4.2: Floor and ceiling functions . Floor function: Function that maps a real number to its closest integer, rounded down Definition: floor: R → Z, where floor(x) = the largest integer y such that y ≤ x. | Notated as such: | . | Ceiling function: Function that maps a real number to its closest integer, rounded down Definition: ceiling: R → Z, where ceiling(x) = the smallest integer y such that x ≤ y. | Notated as such: | . | . 4.3: Properties of functions . A function is one-to-one or injective if each value of x maps to a unique value of y x1 ≠ x2 implies that f(x1) ≠ f(x2) | . | A function is onto or surjective if the range of f is equal to its target For every y ∈ Y, there is an x ∈ X such that f(x) = y | . | A function is bijective if it is both onto and one-to-one Such functions are called bijections or one-to-one correspondences | . | Can infer the sizes, or cardinality, of the domain and target sets depending on the function’s properties If f: D → T is onto, then for every element in the target, there is at least one element in the domain: |D| ≥ |T|. | If f: D → T is one-to-one, then every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the target: |D| ≤ |T|. | If f: D → T is a bijection, then f is one-to-one and onto: |D| ≤ |T| and |D| ≥ |T|, which implies that |D| = |T|. | Visual: | . | . Challenge Activity is good to practice onto vs. one-to-one . 4.4: The inverse of a function . The inverse of a function is found by reversing the order of its tuples; that is, f-1 = { (y, x) : (x, y) ∈ f }. Inverses may not be well-defined, so some functions don’t have inverses | Example: | A function has an inverse if and only if it is a bijection | Analytically solving for the inverse of a function with an infinite domain: | . | . 4.5: Composition of functions . A composition of functions is when a function is applied to another function Example: f(g(x)), or (f ο g)(x) | Visual example: | . | The identity function (denoted by I) takes a set and maps each of its elements onto itself If a function f has an inverse, then f composed with its inverse is an identity function | Mathematical definitions: (f o f-1)(x) = If | Let f: A → B be a bijection. Then f-1 ο f = IA and f ο f-1 = IB. | . | . | . 4.6: Logarithms and exponents . Exponential function and logarithmic function are featured Properties of exponents: | Properties of logarithms: | . | A function is strictly increasing if, for each increasing value of x, f(x) is bigger than the last if whenever x1 &lt; x2, then f(x1) &lt; f(x2) | . | A function is strictly decreasing if, for each increasing value of x, f(x) is smaller than the last if whenever x1 &lt; x2, then f(x1) &gt; f(x2) | . | Logarithmic function is strictly increasing | .",

Ciappelletto is the first “model” storyteller | The rest of the stories fall under Ciappelletto’s; signifies following stories will be raunchy but attempt to appeal to God | . | Day 1 Tales 2, 3, and 4 relate to religion | 2 talks about a Jewish merchant who notices that the Church is corrupt but is prospering because of it, making Christianity favorable; merchant’s reasoning | 3 has a “wise” Jew tell a tale within the tale about how it’s impossible to know which of the major religions was valid; uses metaphor of three brothers with three rings with none of them knowing which ring is real | 4 shows a monk exposing the hypocrisy of his Abbot by playing a trick on him even though the Abbot planned to expose the monk’s trick | . | Bocaccio intends to show that religious officials are not above “regular” humans and are not in a position to judge Also argues that all faiths are similar | Uses merchants to show that you need to work together to prosper | . | . | Day 2’s theme is “reversals of bad to good fortune” | Continues general theme of intelligence | Merchants become frequent protagonists | Day 2 Story 5 takes the form of a folk/fairy tale and shows the romances of education Starts as a typical exposition of a folk tale; Andreuccio hears of Naples and brings 500 gold to make his fortune there | Switch in perspective from Andreuccio to the Sicilian woman | Situational irony: Andreuccio has no knowledge of his situation, but the reader/other characters in the story do | Perugia stands for the land of innocence while Naples stands for the land of cunning and trickery | Story takes place as a series of journeys Perugia to Naples | The journey inside of Naples: inn, market, Malportugia, church/tomb, well | Parody of the “journey to the underworld” | . | Trebling: patterns of three Bocaccio uses trebling to show Andreuccio’s education | Andreuccio falls three times, and each time, he goes into darkness and gains a little bit more insight Fall 1: Falls into the toilet, realizes that he’s been tricked, leaves while naked and covered in sewage | Fall 2: Meets two men who inform him that he would have been killed had he not fallen Is lowered into a well in order to clean up, but the two thieves leave him while guards come | Develops suspicion but still doesn’t know where he’s going | . | Fall 3: Goes into the tomb and grabs the jewelry off of the Archbishop’s finger Understands that the two thieves are trying to trick him, takes the ring and lies to the thieves | Left for dead inside of the tomb, faints and is described as looking like a corpse | . | Andreuccio is able to free himself from the last fall by grabbing the leg of another thief “Resurrected” as a new man who is no longer innocence | . | . | . | Perspective changes throughout the story We are never “with” Andreuccio until when he is in the tomb; always above/below/removed from him | Signals that the listener’s should have empathy only when Andreuccio is in the tomb, as we gain information from him | . | Each fall is a mock version of different moments on a spiritual journey as told on the Christian calendar Fall 1: fall into filth and sin, leaving Eden and going to the real world | Fall 2: Baptism, cleansing of sin | Fall 3: sacrament of Confirmation; Confirmation shows proof that one is Christian, an adolescent kisses the ring on a bishop’s finger Entry into the “light” of Christian knowledge, symbolized by the theives’ lantern | Andreuccio literally steals the ring | . | Has references to Dante, especially in Dante’s books and worlds (Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise) | . | . | .",

            "title": "The Costs of Taxation and International Trade",
            "content": "Chapter 8: Application: The Costs of Taxation . 8-1: The Deadweight Loss of Taxation . How a Tax Affects Market Participants . Recall that the benefit received by buyers is the consumer surplus and the benefit received by sellers is the producer surplus | The tax revenue that the government receives is the size of the tax times the quantity of a good; T x Q Graph: | . | The following graph and bullets represent what taxes do to an economy’s well-being: | Welfare without a Tax The total surplus in a market is reprsented by the entirety of the triangle up to the equilibrium point, as the government isn’t driving a tax wedge into it | . | Welfare with a Tax With the tax, both the consumer and producer surplus is stifled; they only receive a surplus of sizing of triangles A and F, respectively | . | Changes in Welfare After the tax, both consumers and producers are left worse off while the government is better for it | The drop in total surplus is called the deadweightloss and is represented by the area of C + E | . | . Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade . Scenario of how taxes cause deadweight losses: Imagine a cleaner, Malik, and a homeowner, Mei Mei’s value of cleaning the house is $120, and Malik’s cost is $80, so a fair pricing would be $100 (surplus of $40) | If the government levies a $50 tax, there is no good pricing for Malik and Mei If Mei pays $120, then Malik only receives $70 | If Malik charges $80, then Mei pays $130 | . | Business is called off, thus resulting in a deadweight loss | . | Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade. | The graph from before represents the deadweight loss, as those closer to the equilibrium point are closer to the margin and will thus stop doing business if it stops being lucrative | . 8-2: The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss . When the supply/demand is elastic, then the size of the deadweight loss increases drastically, as more buyers/sellers are willing/able to exit the market | Visual Representation: | General rule: the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the larger the deadweight loss of a tax. | . 8-3: Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary . The size of the tax can change the deadweight loss and tax revenue | If the tax is too small, then the government might not realize enough revenue, but if the tax is too large, then it may shrink the market can cause the government (and market) to fail | Graphics: | The size of the deadweight loss is exponential compared to the size of the tax If a tax doubles, then the width and height of the deadweight loss doubles, thus making it increase by a factor of 4 | . | . Lecture Notes . A subsidy actually hurts the total surplus of an economy, as pushing the quantity past its equilibrium leads to a loss in surplus | . Chapter 9: Application: International Trade . 9-1: The Determinants of Trade . The Equilibrium without Trade . Scenario: Imagine a country named Isoland with a textile market that is isolated from the rest of the world Because they are isolated, the textile market consists only of Isolandian buyers and sellers | Graph: | . | A new president is elected and advocates for free trade, asks three questions: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the domestic textile market? | Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the gains exceed the losses? | Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy | | . The World Price and Comparative Advantage . First question that must be asked is whether or not Isoland will be a textile exporter or importer | Economists must compare the current Isolandian price of textiles to other prices of textiles; the current, prevailing price worldwide is called the world price If the world price is greater than the domestic price, then Isoland will become an exporter (producer); if it is lower, then Isoland will become an importer (consumer) | Shows if Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles, thus clarifying what Isoland should specialize in | . | . 9-2: The Winners and Losers from Trade . Must begin with the assumption that Isoland is a small economy and that its actions will have a negligible effect on the world markets; specifically, Isoland will not affect the world price of textiles Economies that cannot affect the price are called price takers; they take the world price | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an exporting country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles rises to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity suppplied is higher than the domestic quantity demanded, but that’s ok because the surplus is sold off as export | Though quantities differ, the world market as a participant keeps the domestic market in equilibrium The horziontal line for world price represents the completely elastic world demand for textiles | . | There are pros and cons; the domestic price increases, so domestic producers are better off while domestic consumers are not The total surplus increases at the cost of consumer surplus; sellers beenfit much more in an exporting country than consumers | . | Two conclusions can be made: When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good are worse off. | Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an importing country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles lowers to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity demanded is higher than the domestic quantity suppplied, but that’s ok because the shortage is bought as import | The supply curve is elastic because Isoland can buy as much of the good as they want at the world price | . The Effects of a Tariff . Tariff: A tax on imported goods from other countries A tariff does not apply to an exporting country because no one would import goods | . | Graph that shows the effect of a tariff: Area D represents the loss from the overproduction of textiles, while area F represents the loss from the underconsumption of textiles Tariff incentivizes marginal sellers to produce at a profit because the tariff raises the price | Tariff deincentivizes marginal buyers to purchase because the tariff raises the price | . | . | After the tariff, the price of the good rises to the equilibrium price before opening up to international trade Domestic sellers are better off (sell at a higher price), domestic buyers are worse off (buy at a higher price), and the government gains rvenue | . | There is a deadweight loss, but it does not amount to the increase in surplus compared to a purely domestic market | . Other Benefits of International Trade . Increased variety of goods: Different goods can only be produced in different countries | Lower costs through economies of scale: Some goods have lower costs of production if created in bulk; having specialized countries allows for a more efficient allocation of resources | Increased competition: Less likelihood of overwhelming market power because the market is bigger | Increased productivity: Only the most productive firms survive and thrive, thus increasing productivity | Enhanced flow of ideas: Import of advanced technologies can help developing countries develop faster | . 9-3: The Arguments for Restricting Trade . The Jobs Argument . Importing goods could destroy domestic firms and cause a lack of jobs Quite the opposite; new jobs open up as a result of trade (merchants, ambassadors, etc.) | Workers in inefficient industries move to advantageous ones | . | Isoland will always have a comparative advantage in some good, so there will always be jobs | . The National-Security Argument . If a domestic market for defense is non-existent (i.e. gun industry, or steel industry to make weaponry), then if war breaks out, the country will be vulnerable due to its dependencies on other countries Argument is legitimate but may be used too liberally; companies who wish to protect their own interests may push the argument extremely fast and exaggerate their roles in national security | . | Some may see a lower steel price as a way to stockpile weaponry at a lower cost | . The Infant-Industry Argument . New industries might ask for protection from foreign industries in order to get off the ground and become competitive Old industries might ask the same in order to adjust to new conditions | Hard to implement and determine effectiveness; must determine which industries will become profitable and if that protection is worth it Picking such industries is difficult, and protections may be more permanent than temporary due to lobbying | . | . | Argument is flawed; if an industry is projected to be profitable, then owners would take a loss in the short term in order to gain in the long run | . The Unfair-Competition Argument . Different laws in different countries can make it hard for some countries to compete If one country provides subsidies or allows for child labor, then they will have an advantage | . | Lower price is not a bad thing; it just means that the country is not competitive in that industry alone and can instead focus on other industries If foreign industries are subsidized, then there is a lower cost of good and no waste of taxpayer dollars | . | . The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument . Governments can threaten and use tariffs as a way to remove other tariffss and lead to freer trade If the threat doesn’t work, then imposing the tariff would hurt the economic welfare of a country, and if a country doesn’t follow through with its tariff, then it loses its standing and reputation | . | . Lecture Notes . Ricardian Trade Model: Gains in trade are due to differences in opportunity costs (AKA comparative advantage) | Quota: A limit on the quantity of imports Same effect as a tariff, but there is no tax revenue, so the decrease in total surplus is even greater | . | Collective Protection Problem Few producers vs. many consumers, easier to organize | . | .",

Welfare Economics: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being Answers questions about how to best organize economic activity | . | . 7-1: Consumer Surplus . Willingness to pay . Willingness to pay: The maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good; represents what a buyer values a good at | Consider the following scenario where four people want to buy an album: | . Buyer Willingness to Pay . Taylor | 100 | . Carrie | 80 | . Rihanna | 70 | . Gaga | 50 | . In an auction, the price would raise to 80$, and Taylor would buy it at 80$ or more (because Carrie is unwilling to pay more) Taylor’s consumer surplus is her willingness to pay minus the price she paid | If there are two albums to sell, then both Taylor and Carrie receive a consumer surplus, and the total market consumer surplus rises | . | . Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus . Can use the demand schedule shown above to create a demand curve Price is represented by the marginal buyer, or the buyer that would leave if the price was raised | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the album drops according to each buyer’s willingness to pay | The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | Demand curve represents maximum willingness to pay | . How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus . At lower prices, the price of the good is lower than more consumers’ value of the good, thus leading to a higher consumer surpus | Graph: | . What Does Consumer Surplus Measure? . Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being from the perspective of the buyers, as they are getting good value | Consumer surplus can sometimes be ignored in a market; lowering the price of heroine is not good but would increase consumer surplus | . 7-2: Producer Surplus . Cost and the Willingness to Sell . Cost: The value of everything (resources, manpower, time) that a seller uses to produce a good, essentially equivalent to willingness to sell | Consider the following scenario where four sellers are competing to paint a house: | . Seller Cost . Vincent | 900 | . Claude | 800 | . Pablo | 600 | . Andy | 500 | . In an auction, the price would start high and quickly lower to 500$; Andy would offer a price of 600$ or slightly lower and take the job (because Pablo is unwilling to sell for lower than 600$) Andy’s consumer surplus is the price he sells his service at minus his cost of production | If there are two houses to paint, then Pablo and Andy will both receive a producer surplus, and the total market producer surplus rises | . | . Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus . Can use the supply schedule shown above to create a supply curve Price is represented by the marginal seller, or the seller that would leave if the price was lowered | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the service raises according to each seller’s cost | The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | . How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus . A higher price increases producer surplus because more producers get a higher profit margin for their service | Graph: | . 7-3: Market Efficiency . The Benevolent Social Planner . Consider a dictator who wants to maximize economic well-being in society | Can calculate total surplus in a market by adding consumer and producer surplus Total surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers = Buyers’ willingness to pay - Sellers’ cost | . | An allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus exhibits **efficiency** Inefficient allocations include ones where producers are, wastefully, having higher costs to produce or ones where goods aren’t consumed by buyers who value them the most | . | Equality: Whether buyers and sellers both have similar levels of economics well-being | Thinking of the market as a pie, efficiency attempts to make the pie as big as possible while equality attempts to split it evenly | . Evaluating the Market Equilibrium . At the equilibrium, the buyers who value the good the most and the sellers who have the lowest cost both consume/produce the good; therefore, the market equilibrium represents the greatest total surplus Graph: | . | Free markets also naturally produce the quantity of goods which maximize total surplus; reducing the quantity creates a shortage, while increasing the quantity creates a surplus Graph: | . | The benevolent dictator need not intervene; the invisible hand of the market will do everything for them | .",

Even integers can be written as 2k; odd ones are written as 2k + 1 (also known as parity) | Same parity is if two numbers are both odd or even; if not, they are of opposite parity | Rational numbers are ones where there exists integers x, where y!= 0 and r = x/y | A number (x) that divides another number (y) is one where y % x == 0 Denoted as x|y (x divides y); x is a multiple of y if it divides it | Numbers that don’t divide are denoted as so: | A number that divides another is called a multiple | . | Prime numbers and composite numbers (if you don’t know this shit ur dumb) | Inequalities: &lt;, &gt;, =, etc. | . 2.2: Introduction to proofs . Theorem: A statement that can be proven to be true via a proof Proofs might use axioms which are statements assumed to be true | . | Theorems are often rewritten as universally or existentially quantified statements | Proof of exhaustion: A proof that is done by examining every element in a domain | Proofs involving universal generalizations uses a statement to define an arbitrary element | Counterexample: definition of one element in a domain that makes the statement false | Existence proofs show that existential statements are true Constructive proofs of existence are the most common, and they provide a specific example in the domain that satisfies the statement | Nonconstructive proofs of existence provide an example with certain properties that satisfies the statement | Disproving existential statements requies DeMorgan’s Law and a proof that a negated statement is true Example: | . | . | . 2.3: Best practices and common errors in proofs . Section includes various important factoids to know . . . . 2.4: Writing direct proofs . Direct proofs: A hypothesis, p, is assumed to be true and the conclusion, c, is proven due to that assumption (p -&gt; c) | . 2.5: Proof by contrapositive . Proof by contrapositive: A proof of a conditional theorem of the form (p -&gt; c) by proving (!c -&gt; !p) Example of what to do with multiple hypotheses: | . | . 2.6: Proof by contradiction . Proof by contradiction assumes that the theorem is false and shows a logical inconsistency with such assumption; also called an indirect proof Example: | . | . 2.7: Proof by cases . Proof by cases: Separates the domain into separate classes (cases) and proves that each class is true Example: | . | Without loss of generality is written to show that one case can apply to all cases Example: | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 5: Elasticity and Its Application . 5-1: The Elasticity of Demand . Elasticity: A measure of a good’s quantity supplied/demanded in response to a change in price | . The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of demand: how much the quantity demanded changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in demand in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Factors of price elasticity of demand Availability of Close Substitutes: Goods with substitutes are elastic while those without are not | Necessities vs. Luxuries: Necessities are inelastic (demand will always remain the same) while luxuries are elastic | Definition of the Market: Items in a broad market (food industry) are more inelastic due to the lack of close substitutes, while items in a narrow market (vanilla ice cream) are elastic | Time Horizon: Good become more elastic with time; short term changes may be small, but long term ones are bigger | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand . Formula for price elasticity of demand is defined as: A note about the formule; the change in quantity demanded is negative, while the change in price is positive. Economists use the absolute value to make it easier | . | . The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities . If you use the above formula to calculate elasticity, then the elasticity from Point A to Point B may be different than Point B to Point A | Midpoint formula is better suited: Doesn’t change based on direction | . | Concept is more important than calculation for this book | . The Variety of Demand Curves . Demand is elastic when elasticity is greater than one and inelastic if not When the elasticity is equal to one, the demand is at unit elasticity | Rule of thumb for demand curves: slope is close to 0 = demand is elastic, slope is close to infinity = demand is inelastic | . . | . Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand . Total revenue: Price of a good * Quantity of good sold Graphical representation: | . | Total revenue is affected by elasticity An increase in price of an inelastic good increases revenue while an increase in price of an inelastic good decreases revenue | A unit elastic good will not experience a change in total revenue if the price changes | . | . Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve . Despite having a constant slope, a linear demand curve can have varying elasticities due to differences in percent change At high prices with low quantities, the curve is elastic, while at low prices with high quantities, the curve is inelastic | Graph and table: | Total revenue changes based on elasticities as well | . | . Other Demand Elasticities . The income elasticity of demand is the measure of how quantity demanded changes based on changes in income Formula: | Normal goods have positive income elasticities while inferior goods have negative ones | Engel’s Law stipulates: As a family’s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one. By contrast, luxuries such as jewelry and recreational goods tend to have large income elasticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their incomes are too low. | In other words, if an item makes up a small part of your income, the item is more inelastic because you can afford to pay the difference in price | . | The cross-price elasticity of demand is the measure of how the quantity demanded changes based on price changes of another good Formula: | Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities while complement goods have negative ones | . | . 5-2: The Elasticity of Supply . The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of supply: how much the quantity supplied changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in supply in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Elasticity depends on how easy it is for sellers to change the quantity supplied Beachfront land is inelastic (cannot create more) but manufactured goods are elastic | . | Key determinant of price elasticity of supply is time period Supply is more elastic in the long run vs. short run, as firms cannot change the size of factories easily in a short period of time | Other changes, such as closing and opening, make products more elastic | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply . Formula for price elasticity of supply is defined as: | . The Variety of Supply Curves . On a graph, a slope closer to infinity is inelastic while a slope closer to 0 is elastic | . . 5-3: Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity . Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers? . Scenario: you are a wehat farmer who spends time making your land as productive as possible | New strand of wheat is found that increases wheat production by 20% | Because wheat (food) is an inelastic good, the total revenue falls when the quantity sold increases Farmers lose money, but they must use the new strand in order to remain competitive with other farmers | . | Affect of advancements in farming can be seen in the vast decrease in workers in the farm industry | Negative effect on farmers still has a positive effect on society; food is cheaper, more workers to do other things | . Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High? . Scenario: OPEC raised the price of oil to increase income From 1973 to 1974, oil prices raised 50%, and they continued to rise | . | OPEC was unable to maintain a high price of oil, and it went back down to low prices during the 90s | Can be explained by elasticities Oil is inelastic, and short term prices rose because people needed to buy oil | In the long term, non-OPEC countries found different ways to produce oil and oil consumption was made more efficient | . | Short term cuts to supply can lead to short term gains but will lose money in the long run | . . Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime? . Scenario: drug use is a serious problem, and the government tries to reduce the amount of drugs in the country | A raise in law enforcement for drugs reduces the quantity supplied for drugs Raises the price of drugs and reduces the quantity demanded for drugs | . | Demand for drugs remains inelastic (drug users will continue to want drugs), so drug users must pay more money for drugs which leads to crimes in order to obtain said money | Reducing demand for drugs can be more beneficial, as it will reduce both the price and quantity of drugs | Some argue that enforcing drug laws could be more beneficial to stopping drug crimes in the long run than in the short run, as goods become more elastic over time | . . Chapter 6: Supply, Demand, and Government Policies . 6-1: Controls on Prices . Different groups may want the equilibrium price of a good to go up or down based on their interests, and will lobby legislators to change the price Legislators can create a price ceiling (price maximum, favored by buyers) or price floor (price minimum, favored by suppliers) to make it so that the price can’t go beyond a certain range | . | . How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes . A price ceiling above the equilibrium price is not binding and has no effect on the price or quantity of ice cream | A price ceiling below the equilibrium price is a binding constraint and affects the good Leads to a shortage because there is too much demand but not enough supply | Due to the shortage of the good, sellers must ration their supply to buyers Includes imposing long lines or selling to favored groups (family, friends, racial/ethnic groups, etc.) | . | General rule: When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buyers | Binding constraints are undesirable because discrimination by seller bias is both inefficient and unfair | . | . . How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes . Binding price floors create a surplus of supply because the demand is too low for the supply Surplus of supply leads to further biases on the buyers’ side “Rationing” from buyers could include buying from sellers who are friends, family, of a certain race, etc. | . | . | Example: Increasing the minimum wage increases the supply of labor but decreases the demand for it, leading to more unemployment | . . Evaluating Price Controls . Economists dislike price controls because free markets tend to be the best way to organize economic activity Prices are the evolution of millions of decisions and settle at optimal values | . | The government can help to improve an economy, but setting price controls might hurt a group that they want to help A suggestion is to pay rent subsidies rather than create price controls | . | . 6-2: Taxes . Tax incidence: How taxes are distributed throughout a market | . How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers for each sale of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on sellers, the supply curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the input price is higher, the supply curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts upward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The supply curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The tax makes buyers worse off because they have to pay more for ice cream | The tax makes sellers worse off because, despite the increase in price, they lose 50 cents every sale | . | Taxes discourage market activity, decreasing the quantity sold of a good | Buyers and sellers both share the burden of taxes | Graph: | . How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers on each purchase of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the price is higher, the demand curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts downward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The demand curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up (after adding the 50 cent tax) and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The effect of a tax on buyers and sellers are the same; the sellers sell for $2.80 and the buyers buy for $3.30, thus reducing the market for ice cream | 50 cents always goes to the government which is the reason for the similarity | . | Graph: | . Elasticity and Tax Incidence . Depending on elasticity, the tax incidence can vary greatly | Graph: | The more inelastic of supply/demand is the one who has the heavier tax burden (“A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic”) This is due to the ability/willingness of buyers/sellers to change the quantity demanded/supplied of a good | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand . 4-1: Markets and Competition . What is a Market? . Market: The buyers and sellers of a good or service Buyers determine demand, sellers determine demand | Markets can be organized or disorganized Crop market is organized; sellers meet together and determine how much supply there is while buyers gather and auction for goods | Smaller, local markets (say, ice cream) are unorganized; ice cream stores are not in contact with each other and buyers don’t meet | . | . | . What is Competition? . Prices are determined by the entire market, as everyone is competing with each other | Competitive Market: A market with enough participants (buyers and sellers) that no one individual has a significant impact on the market For this chapter, markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive; all sold goods are exactly the same, and there are enough buyers and sellers that no one can influence the market heavily | Buyers and sellers are price takers; they can buy and sell as much as they want but only at the market price | Easy entry and exit from the industry in the long-run | . | Many markets are (nearly) perfectly competitive, but some have only one seller, leading to a monopoly | . 4-2: Demand . The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded . Quantity Demanded: The amount of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to purchase Many factors can affect quantity demanded, but the assumed, simplified market will focus on one: price | Law of Demand: Considering everything else equal, price and demand are inverse; when price rises, demand lowers, and vice versa | Graphical representation: | Above table is an example of a demand schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded | The graph shown is known as the demand curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded; typically slopes downwards | . | . Market Demand versus Individual Demand . Market Demand is the sum of all of the individual demands for a good or service Example of creating a market demand curve from two individual demand curves: | . | . Shifts in the Demand Curve . Income Lower income means that a demand curve falls, as there is less money to spend | Normal good: A good whose demand falls when income falls | Inferior good: A good whose demand increases when income falls (such as public transportation) | . | Prices of Related Goods Substitutes: Two or more goods that are similar enough to be affected by each otehrs prices If the cost of ice cream goes down, then the demand for frozen yogurt goes down too (because froyo is more expensive and fairly similar) | . | Complements: Two or more goods that will go up or down in demand together depending on their prices If the price of tapioca pearls lowers, then the demand for both pearls and tea will increase | . | . | Tastes Depending on your tastes, you may buy more or less of a good/service; hard to explain and unscientific | . | Expectations What you expect to happen can affect your behavior; if you think a disaster will occur, you’re more willing to buy more survival goods and less willing to buy unnecessary goods | . | Number of Buyers Adding buyers increases demand and lowering buyers decreases demand | . | . Additional Notes . The relationship between demand and quantity demanded is negative for two reasons Substitution effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers substitute it by buying similar products instead | Income effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers’ purchasing power goes down, and the consumer buys less of the good but more of other goods | . | Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: The idea that each additional unit of a good that you receive becomes lower in value (or utility) as you receive more Indifference Curve: A curve showing the relationship between two goods that a consumer needs/likes; takes the shape of 1/x and is convex | . | . 4-3: Supply . The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied . Quantity Supplied: The amount of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell A big determinant is price; when price of ice cream is high, the quantity supplied increases (because sellers want to make a higher profit) and vice versa | Law of Supply: Considering everything else equal, price and supply are related; when price rises, supply increases, and vice versa | Graphical Representation: | Above table is an example of a supply schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied | The graph shown is known as the supply curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity supply; typically slopes upwards | . | . Market Supply versus Individual Supply . Market supply is the sum of all individual supplies | . Shifts in the Supply Curve . Input Prices The price of the inputs to make a good/service (ingredients, machinery, manpower) affects the quantity supplied | Increase in input price lowers quantity supplied and vice versa | . | Technology Advancements in technology increases the quantity supplied because it becomes cheaper/faster to produce | . | Expectations A firm that expects the popularity of a good/service to rise may produce more of it, and vice versa | If the price is expected to decrease, firms will supply more | . | Number of sellers More sellers = more quantity supplied, and vice versa | . | . 4-4: Supply and Demand Together . Equilibrium . When a supply curve and demand curve are graphed together, there is a singular point of interception That point is called the equilibrium, with the price representing the equilibrium price and the quantity representing the equilibrium quantity | Equilibrium point is in perfect balance; the quantity and price is the same that the buyers demand and the sellers supply | . | Naturally, prices and quantity move towards the equilibrium point If there is too much supply compared to demand, then there is a surplus and sellers cannot sell their goods at the current price Sellers have too much supply; begin to cut prices, thus increasing demand, lowering prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | If there is too much demand compared to supply, then there is a shortage and buyers cannot buy the goods they want due to a lack of availability Sellers are enabled to raise prices, thus lowering demand, increasing prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | . | . . Theory of equilibrium leads to Law of Supply and Demand: the price of a good naturally adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance | . Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium . Must analyze events which affect equilibriums with three steps Does it change the supply curve, demand curve, or both? | Does it shift the curve to the left or right? | Compare the supply-and-demand diagrams to see how the shift affected the equilibrium point | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand One summer, it is more hot than usual Hot weather increases demand for ice cream but does not change supply curve | More demand shifts the demand curve to the right | Demand curve now meets the supply curve at a higher price and quantity | . | . | Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves In the last example, the actual supply curve didn’t move; instead, the equilibrium point moved upwards along the curve | A shift in the supply/demand curve is called a “change” while a movement along the supply/demand curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied/demanded” | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply One summer, a hurricane destroys a sugarcane crop, increasing the price of sugar Raise in input costs leads to a reduction in the amount of ice cream produced | Less supply shifts the supply curve to the left | There is now a shortage of ice cream, and the equilibrium point moves left along the demand curve | . | . | Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand Let’s say that the hot weather and hurricane occurred in the same summer Both curves shift; the demand increases because of the heat, and the supply decreases because of a higher input cost | Demand curve shifts to the right, and supply curve shifts to the left | Depending on the size of the shifts, there are two possible outcomes, but both result in an increase in equilibrium price | . | . | . . Discussion Notes: Price typically falls on the y axis, and quantity falls on the x axis | Total revenue (p x q) follows a parabolic shape (goes up, plateaus, then goes down) | Elasticity: The change in price divided by the change in quantity; %deltaQ/%deltaP Typically calculated using derivatives, but can use a midpoint formula ∣Q2−Q1(Q1+Q2)/2P2−P1(P1+P2)/2∣| { {Q_2 - Q_1 over (Q_1 + Q_2) / 2} over {P_2 - P_1 over (P_1 + P_2) / 2} } |∣(P1​+P2​)/2P2​−P1​​(Q1​+Q2​)/2Q2​−Q1​​​∣ | . | Unit elastic is when your elasticity is equal to 1; over 1 is elastic, and under 1 is inelastic | Goods with substitutes are usually elastic, while necessities are inelastic | Decrease in price of an elastic good will increase revenue, while a decrease in price of an inelastic good will decrease revenue | . | . | Lecture Notes: Supply curves should start above (0, 0) because companies need to cover fixed costs | Regular equations for curves start with Q (Q = mP + b), but if P is on the left, then it is called inverse demand/supply | . | .",

Predicate: A statement whose truth value depends on one or more variables, even if the outcome is predetermined Represented as a function; “P of x” | Ex: “x is an even number” would be true if x = 4, but not if x = 5 | Domain: All of the possible values of x for a predicate “x is an even number” would have a domain of all natural numbers | If not apparent from context, should be defined in the predicate | . | Predicates do not have to be strictly mathematical; general statements can be turned into predicates as well | . | Universal quantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∀ which reads as “for all” ∀x P(x) reads as “for every x, P(x)” and is a proposition that only returns true if every x in the domain is true ∀x P(x) is a universally quantified statement | . | Proof showing that a universally quantified statement is true: . | Counterexample: An element in the domain of a universally quantified statement that is false; used to prove that a statement is false | . | Existensial equantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∃ which reads as “there exists” ∃x P(x) reads as “there exists an x, such that P(x)” and is a proposition that returns true if any x in the domain is true ∃x P(x) is an existentially quantified statement | . | Example: An element in the domain of a existentially quantified statement that is true; used to prove that a statement is true | Proof showing that an existentially quantified statement is false: | . | . . 1.7: Quantified statements . Can combine quantifiers and logical expressions to create quantified statements Example: Let P(x) = x is prime and O(x) = x is odd; ∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬O(x)) states that there exists a positive number that is prime and not odd | . | A free variable is defined as a variable that can be any value in the domain, while a bound variable is defined as a variable that is bound to a quantifier x in P(x) is a free variable, while x in ∃x P(x) is a bound variable | A statement is a proposition if it contains no free variables | . | Can express quantified statements in English Let P(x) = x came to the party and S(x) = x was sick | ∃x (S(x) ∨ P(x)) is true because Joe satisfies the proposition: S(Joe) ∨ P(Joe) == True | . | . Name S(x) P(x) . Joe | F | T | . Theodore | T | F | . Gertrude | F | T | . Samuel | F | F | . If there are no values in the domain/set, then a universally quantified statement is vacuously true and a existentially quantified statement is false | . . 1.8: De Morgan’s law for quantified statements . ¬∀x F(x) can be rewritten as ∃x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∀x F(x) ≡ ∃x ¬F(x) Ex: “Not every bird can fly” == “There exists a bird that cannot fly” | . | Likewise, ¬∃x F(x) can be rewritten as ∀x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∃x F(x) ≡ ∀x ¬F(x) Ex: “There does not exist a bird that can fly” == “Every bird cannot fly” | . | When simplifying a quantifier, make sure to use a double negation on it Example: | . | . . 1.9: Nested quantifiers . When there are multiple variables in a predicate, you must use multiple, nested quantifiers Examples of nested quantifiers: | . | Propositions with multiple variables can be thought of as pairs Take ∀x ∀y M(x, y); this proposition is false if there is ANY pair of x, y that does not satisfy M(x, y) (including if x and y are the same) | For ∃x ∃y M(x, y), the proposition is false if ALL pairs of x, y are not true for M(x, y) (also including if x and y are the same) | . | If a quantified statement has two quantifiers (one existential (∃) and one universal (∀)), it’s effective to think of the statement as a two player game The existential player (variable) tries to make the expression true, while the universal player (variable) tries to make the expression false | The player (variable) on the left goes first, and the next player (variable) tries their best to succeed in their goal | Ex: In ∀x ∃y (x + y = 0), x goes first and chooses a random value; y tries its best to set x + y = 0 and is successful because it can always become -x | . | DeMorgan’s can be applied to nested quantifiers as well; it switches the signs of the quantifier to its opposite | . . . 1.10: More nested quantified statements . If you want to express ∀x ∀y without including situations where x == y, then you can write the proposition as ∀x ∀y ((x ≠ y) → M(x, y)) If x == y, then x, y cannot be used as a counter example because it’s not false | . | To express uniqueness, you can use a combination of nested quantifiers and conditionals | . . You can also move the quantifiers depending on where it is located in the statement | . . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.10.1 is good practice . . 1.11: Logical reasoning . Argument: A sequence of propsitions (AKA hypotheses) that is followed by a final proposition (AKA conclusion) Valid arguments have true conclusions when all hypotheses are true; invalid otherwise | ∴ symbol denotes “therefore” | Commutative law allows hypotheses to be in any order . | Ex: These two arguments are the same | Proving an arguments validity via truth table: . | You can prove that an argument is invalid by showing an example where the hypotheses are true but the conclusion is not | . | An argument’s form is found by replacing propositions with variables Ex: “It is raining today. + If it is raining today, I will not ride my bike to school. ∴ I will not ride my bike to school.” can be replaced with “p + (p –&gt; q) ∴ q” | Forms can be useful because it can invalidate an argument with known truth values Ex: | . | . | If an argument does not have an assignment where the hypotheses are true, then the argument is valid | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.11.1 is good practice . Questions: . What is the difference between (x != y) -&gt; and (x != y) ^? Is it because ^ is for existentials and -&gt; is for universals? .",

            "title": "Principles of Economics Ch. 1-3",
            "content": "Chapter 1: Ten Principles of Economics . By nature, resources are scarce, meaning that they are limited and not everyone can get whatever they want | Economics: study of how society manages its resources No one person controls all of the resources; every individual has a say in how a resource is distributed | Economists study how people make decisions based on resources (work, purchases, savings, etc.) | Economists also study larger forces/trends such as unemployment, income growth, inflation, etc. | . | . 1-1: How People Make Decisions . Summary: People make decisions based on what they have to give (opportunity cost) and comparing it to what they get. Rational people try to get the best outcome possible and use marginal changes to get the most out of their resources. Rational people also consider the costs and benefits of a purchase/behaving a certain way. . Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs . Most decisions require trade-offs; give something you like to get something you like | Types of trade-offs in society “Guns and butter”: The more spent on military/defense (guns), the less spent on quality of life goods (butter) Relates to trade-off between clean environment and high income; costs more for a factory to produce goods cleanly, so they might have to provide lower wages, charge higher prices, etc. | . | Efficiency and equality: getting the most out of a society’s resources vs. giving out products equally amongst members of the society (respectively) “Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices” | Efficiency and equality conflict with each other; giving poor people money (equality+) means that people may not work as hard and production goes down (efficiency-) | . | Trade-offs are key to understanding economics, as people try to make trade-offs most beneficial to them | . | . Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It . Opportunity cost: Everything you give up to get an item, including time, health, money, etc. Ex. Many athletes believe that spending 4 years in college has too high of an opportunity cost compared to going straight to a pro league | . | . Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin . Economy assumes people are rational, or that they try their hardest to get the best outcome | Decisions are not black and white (buy a 3m$ house or be homeless?), so rational people use marginal change to slowly adjust their plans in order to get the best result Marginal costs should be taken into account when making decisions | Ex. It’s free to watch another movie if you’ve already paid for a monthly subscription, or an airline can seat another person if they have empty seats; both marginal costs are zero | . | A classic example is “a cup of water vs. a diamond”; marginally, getting one more cup of water is much easier than getting a(nother) diamond, so water costs less | Rational decisions are ones where the marginal benefit (gaining one more unit) is greater than the marginal cost (how much does that extra unit cost?) | . Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives . Incentive: Something that encourages a person to act Ex. If apple prices rise, then consumers will buy fewer apples and producers will produce more apples | Public policymakers use incentives to affect the behaviors of citizens; taxing cigarettes causes less people to smoke | Incentives often affect cost-benefit calculations and must be taken into consideration | . | . 1-2: How People Interact . Summary: People trade in order to maximize their production, as trade allows for specialization. Markets facilitate trade, and governments often step in to ensure that the market runs smoothly. . Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off . Competition and trading can benefit all parties Each person trades goods (work, most commonly) for other goods (food, homes, cars, etc.); competitive pricing forces goods to have low prices, benefiting consumers | Not participating in trade/competition means that people would have to grow their own food, build their own house, etc. | Trading allows for specialization and more advanced societies | . | . Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity . Communism was founded on principle that the government should control the economy (central planning) AKA Command Economy | Most countries that had central planning stopped using it in favor of a market economy | Government decides on the producers, the level of output, the consumers; pretty much everything | . | Market Economy: an economy that is based on the decisions of individual households, companies, firms, etc. to exchange goods and services; decisions are made based on whatever is the most profitable/whatever provides the best outcome Can seem dangerous (no governing authority to ensure equality), but people make decisions as if guided by “an invisible hand (Adam Smith) | Prices are the main way the economy is controlled; determines the demand from buyers and the supply from sellers, thus displaying the value of a product to society | When a government interrupts the forces of natural supply and demand, the decisions of individuals don’t follow the invisible hand as much Shows why communism failed: prices didn’t change to reflect the true values of products | Leads to excesses and shortages because the government doesn’t know how much demand there is | . | Products such as Uber show the inner workings of market economies | . | . Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes . Governments are necessary to enforce rules that are important to a market economy These rules include property rights; individuals must be able to own and control their resources freely | . | Governments also choose whether or not to promote efficiency or equality Occasionally, a market failure occurs where a free market is inefficient in its distribution of resources; government must step in to make it efficient Can be caused by externality: the actions of one affects the health/well-being of another (such as pollution) Can negatively or positively affect consumption and production | Examples include smoking cigarettes, pollution, education, or a bee farm next to an orange orchard | . | Can also be caused by market power: one (or a few) person(s) or group(s) control a resource and can unnaturally change its price due to its necessity | Asymmetric Information: one party has more information than another; can lie and be dishonest with a price Adverse Selection: Market failure where products of lower quality are sold at the same price as those of higher quality; too many low quality products are sold | Moral Hazard: When a party can change their behavior without taking on risk, typically in the form of insurance | . | . | Free markets can cause large wealth disparities and inequalities; government can step in and provide basic goods + welfare for those at the bottom of the economic ladder | . | Public policy not always perfect; can be corrupted or abused | . 1-3: How the Economy as a Whole Works . Summary: Countries that are able to produce more goods and services have a higher standard of living. Printing can stimulate an economy, leading to the hiring of more workers, but it can also lead to higher inflation. Often, printing money (or the lack thereof) causes random business cycles. . Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services . Different countries have different qualities of life and average incomes; higher income == higher quality of life This difference relies on a countries’ productivity, or the goods/services output per unit of work input | Countries with higher productivities generally have a higher standard of living than countries with lower productivities This relationship means that other factors are far less important in determining standard of living | . | Policy makers must create policy based on increasing productivity | . | . Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money . Inflation: A rise in prices across an economy Inflation typically occurs because governments print money; more money –&gt; money is less valuable –&gt; prices increase | . | . Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment . Printing money stimulates the economy, causes companies to hire more people, and increases production BUT it causes higher prices in the long term Leads to business cycles: large, irregular, and unpredictable changes in economic activity | Government spending, printing, and taxing can all affect inflation, productivity, and more - it’s up for debate how much (if at all) the government should do | . | . . Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist . 2-1: The Economist as Scientist . Summary: Economists can act as a scientist in the sense that they create hypotheses in order to understand more about the field. They must make assumptions in order to form these hypotheses/conclusions. There are many models to represent an economy. There are two studies of economics: micro and macro. . The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation . Newton first observed an apple fall, created a theory about gravity, and observed to see if his theory was correct; this method can be applied to economics Ex. An economist could theorize that inflation and high prices were related, then gather data from countries and see if his theory is correct | . | Difference between traditional sciences and economics is that economics cannot create controlled experiments; they must make do with real world data Historical events often provide the best study cases for how a key resource affects an economy, such as wars in the Middle East | . | . The Role of Assumptions . Economists must make assumptions in order to simplify complex situations and clarify them Ex. Breaking down a complicated problem (analyzing international trade) into smaller parts (analyze trade between two countries and with two products) to better understand the concepts | . | The elegance of economics is deciding what assumptions to use Ex. When studying effects of inflation on price, you could assume that short term prices will stay similar while long term prices will fluctuate greatly | . | . Economic Models . Models often omit details to show what is really important and are built with assumptions | . Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram . Circular-flow diagram is used to show how groups in an economy interact with each other | In the diagram, households (consumers) and firms (producers) participate in two markets Markets for goods and services are ones where households buy the products of firms | Markets for the factors of production are ones where households provide input (labor, money, etc.) to firms for the firms to create goods and services | . | Inner loop represents the flow of inputs (labor, land, capital) and outputs (goods and services) | Outer loop represents the flow of dollars/money; paying wages, buying goods, etc. | Circular-flow diagram is good to understand how different parts of the economy interact | Assumed that there is no government intervention, foreign trade | . Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier . Most economic models are built using mathematics | The production possibilities frontier is a graph that displays the different levels of output for two goods (assuming that an economy only produces those two goods) | The outermost line represents the maximum efficiency of the economy (efficient combinations lie on this line); can only produce that many products given its resources Any points outside of the border (such as point C) cannot be reached in the current state of the economy | Any points inside of the border but not on the line (such as point D) are deemd inefficient because they don’t use the maximum amount of resources | . | The graph relates to both trade-offs and opportunity costs Trade-off between producing more/less of one product than the other | Opportunity cost is depends on the slope of the frontier; lower slope = lower opportunity cost, steeper slope = higher opportunity cost | . | Econoomists believe that production possibilities frontiers will generally have a curved shape Ex. If all of an economy’s resources (including car makers) are being used to make computers, then making one car will barely inhibit computer production and vice verse; leads to different slopes at the ends | . | Frontiers can shift depending on economic growth or change | The frontier establishes scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and growth; good model for demonstrating economics | . Microeconomics and Macroeconomics . Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms interact with each other and make decisions on a small scale (in one market, for example) | Macroeconomics: The study of how things can affect an entire economy | Both are tied to each other; impossible to understand macroeconomic concepts without knowing microeconomic ones Both fields are still very different, warranting different courses | . | . 2-2: The Economist as Policy Advisor . Summary: Economists can make either positive or normative statements. Policymakers listen to these statements and form laws based on the advice, though economists are not always listened to. . Positive versus Normative Analysis . A positive statement is objective and makes a statement about how the world is | A normative statement is subjective and makes a statement about how the world should be | Positive statements can be analyzed, rationed with, and (dis)proven, while normative statements must be evaluated using both facts and moral values | . Economists in Washington . Economists must describe both options to policy makers in order for them to make a well-informed decision | Economists give advice, formulate plans, design tax policy, analyze data, evalutate public policy, provide new insight through research and publications, and more | . Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed . Economic policy, in practice, cannot be enforced as it would be in theory | Lawmakers must appeal to the masses (as well as Congress) and change portions of suggested economic policy in order to do so | . 2-3: Why Economists Disagree . Summary: Economists disagree on issues because they have different values and may interpret data differently. However, there are many “controversial” issues that economists typically agree on. . Differences in Scientific Judgments . Economists are always trying to understand world economies, so they might disagree if they interpret certain discoveries differently This includes controversial concepts like supply-side economics and welfare | . | . Differences in Values . Economists may disagree on the “fairness” of policies based on their values or upbringings | . Perception versus Reality . Economists agree on many propositions that may be more controversial to the public, such as rent control and enforcing tariffs Despite the fact that economists agree, if politicans were to implement such policies (like rent control), they might not get reelected/lose popularity, thus causing contradictions between public policy and agreed upon propositions | . | . . Chapter 3: Interdependence and the Gains from Trade . 3-1: A Parable for the Modern Economy . Summary: Trade can benefit both parties even if one party is absolutely better than the other at producing a certain good. Trade allows for specialization. . Scenario: Let’s say there are two people, Ruby and Frank, and two goods, beef and potatoes Ruby can only produce beef and Frank can only produce potatoes | Both parties would benefit from trading with each other, as they would have more variety in their diets (beef + potatoes vs. only beef or only potatoes) | Can also trade other things; if Ruby can’t farm potatoes well and Frank can’t raise cattle, then they could trade farms | . | Guiding Question: What if one person is better at producing every good? | . Production Possibilities . Assuming that Frank and Ruby could work 8 hours a day, they can only devote so much time to raising cattle or growing potatoes | Production possibilities frontier for both farmers: These frontiers are not curved (or “bowed-out”) because each farmer’s efficiency remains the same regardless the amount of time spent on either task | . | The frontiers show us what would happen if both farmers were self sufficient and are good at displaying the trade-offs they make, but aren’t effective at showing what decisions they would make | . Specialization and Trade . Ruby tells Frank to spend all of his time farming potatoes (which he is more efficient at) | Ruby spends more of her time farming cattle (which she is better at than Frank) and some of her time growing potatoes | By specializing and trading their specialized goods, both farmers benefit and consume more of both foods | . 3-2: Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization** . Summary: Comparative advantage determines how trade is conducted; if both parties have a comparative advantage over one another, then they can export the good that they are more efficient in producing. For both parties to benefit, the price of trade should be between their opportunity costs. . Absolute Advantage . Absolute advantage is used to compare two firms, countries, people, etc.; one group has an absolute advantage if they use less inputs for the same output Ruby takes 20 minutes to make an ounce of meat and 10 minutes to make an ounce of potatoes, while Frank takes 60 and 15 minutes, respectively; Ruby has an absolute advantage over Frank | . | . Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage . In this scenario, opportunity cost represents the trade-off in time between producing meat and potatoes Ruby can make 2 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; her opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/2 ounce of meat | Frank can make 4 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; his opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/4 ounce of meat | . | Comparative advantage: Having a lower opportunity cost to produce a good compared to another producer Despite Frank being worse at producing both goods, he has a comparative advantage over Ruby because 1/4 &lt; 1/2 | One person cannot have a comparative advantage in both goods because the comparative advantages are inverse; if you have a low opportunity cost for one good, it’ll be higher for the other good | . | . Comparative Advantage and Trade . When people specialize in producing a good that they have a comparative advantage in, the total production of the economy rises, making everyone better off | By trading, people can obtain goods at a lower opportunity cost and therefore get more net goods | . The Price of Trade . To determine the price at which parties trade at, a general rule can be applied: For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between their opportunity costs Frank and Ruby trade at a price of 3 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat; Ruby’s opportunity cost is 2 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat and Frank’s is 4 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat | Any price between 2 and 4 would benefit both parties If below 2, then both parties would want to buy meat because it’s cheaper than their opportunity cost; if above 4, then both parties would want to sell meat because the price is higher than their opportunity cost | . | . | . 3-3: Applications of Comparative Advantage . Summary: Examples of how comparative advantages apply to the real world. . Should LeBron James Mow His Own Lawn? . James is a great athlete, but the time he wastes on mowing his lawn could be used on other things such as recording a commercial or otherwise Regular people have a comparative advantage over James, so James should hire people to mow his lawn for him (and compensate them at a price that is higher than their opportunity cost) | . | . Should the United States Trade with Other Countries? . Goods bought from abroad are called imports and goods sold to other countries are exports | If one country is more adept at producing a certain good compared to another country, then they should export that good while importing a good that said other country has a comparative advantage in | Trade can benefit both parties, but it may hurt individuals; importing cars and exporting farmed goods affects autoworkers and farmers differently | .",

Proposition: A statement that is either true or false Does not include commands (Shut the door!) or questions (What time is it?) | Propositions have a truth value, can be either: true, false, unknown, or a matter of opinion | . | A compound proposition is the combination of propositions using a logical operator ∧ represents “and”; p ∧ q is true if both p and q are true AKA conjunction operator | Truth table: | . | ∨ represents “or”; p ∨ q is true if either p or q are true AKA disjunction operator | Truth Table: | . | In English, “or” is typically used to represent “either/or”, or exclusive or (represented by ⊕), where both conditions cannot be true at the same time (She is eating or running) Only difference is that T ⊕ T == F while T ∨ T == T | ∨ represents inclusive or where both conditions CAN be true at the same time | . | ¬ represents negation, or NOT; ¬True == False and ¬False == True | . | . . 1.2 Evaluating compound propositions . Compound propositions can have more than one operation Order of operations w/o parantheses: ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or) | Good practice to use parantheses | . | Truth tables will contain 2n rows for n variables(2 options for each variable) | Rightmost variable is filled in with TFTF…, leftmost is filled in with TTFF…; T and F alternates based on 2column number where rightmost column = 1 | . | Example of a truth table with intermediate steps: | . . 1.3 Conditional statements . Conditional operations are represented with the symbol → p → q is read as “if p then q” | Truth table: | Think of it as a contract; if condition one is fulfilled, then the second condition HAS to be fulfilled, but if condition one is not fulfilled, then the second condition can either be fulfilled or not. | Different ways to express conditional operations: | p only if q is also p → q; most confusing one | . | Related conditional statements include the contrapositive, converse, and inverse The converse of p → q is q → p | The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p | The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q | . | Biconditional operations are represented with ↔ p ↔ q stands for “p if and only if q” - AKA true if p == q and false if not | If and only if can be represented with iff | . | Conditional and biconditional operations can be used in conjunction with other operations ∧, ∨, and ¬ takes precedence before → or ↔ | . | . . 1.4 Logical equivalence . A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, while a contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false p ∨ ¬p is a tautology, while p ∧ ¬p is a contradiction | . | Logical equivalence means that two compound propositions always return the same value ≡ is used to denote logical equivalence | If s ≡ r, then s ↔ r is a tautology, and s ≡ r if and only if r ≡ s | . | De Morgan’s Laws are laws that use logical equivalences to show how to distribute negation, or NOT, operations First version of the law: ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q) or !(p or q) == !p and !q | Second version of the law: ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) or !(p and q) == !p or !q | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.4.1 is a great capstone activity for practice . . 1.5 Laws of propositional logic . You can substitute a proposition in for another one if both propositions are logically equivalent ex: Because p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q, (p ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ≡ (p ∨ r) ∧ (p → q) | Useful laws for logical equivalence: | . | .
