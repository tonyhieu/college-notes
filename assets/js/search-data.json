The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of demand: how much the quantity demanded changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in demand in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Factors of price elasticity of demand Availability of Close Substitutes: Goods with substitutes are elastic while those without are not | Necessities vs. Luxuries: Necessities are inelastic (demand will always remain the same) while luxuries are elastic | Definition of the Market: Items in a broad market (food industry) are more inelastic due to the lack of close substitutes, while items in a narrow market (vanilla ice cream) are elastic | Time Horizon: Good become more elastic with time; short term changes may be small, but long term ones are bigger | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand . Formula for price elasticity of demand is defined as: A note about the formule; the change in quantity demanded is negative, while the change in price is positive. Economists use the absolute value to make it easier | . | . The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities . If you use the above formula to calculate elasticity, then the elasticity from Point A to Point B may be different than Point B to Point A | Midpoint formula is better suited: Doesn’t change based on direction | . | Concept is more important than calculation for this book | . The Variety of Demand Curves . Demand is elastic when elasticity is greater than one and inelastic if not When the elasticity is equal to one, the demand is at unit elasticity | Rule of thumb for demand curves: slope is close to 0 = demand is elastic, slope is close to infinity = demand is inelastic | . . | . Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand . Total revenue: Price of a good * Quantity of good sold Graphical representation: | . | Total revenue is affected by elasticity An increase in price of an inelastic good increases revenue while an increase in price of an inelastic good decreases revenue | A unit elastic good will not experience a change in total revenue if the price changes | . | . Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve . Despite having a constant slope, a linear demand curve can have varying elasticities due to differences in percent change At high prices with low quantities, the curve is elastic, while at low prices with high quantities, the curve is inelastic | Graph and table: | Total revenue changes based on elasticities as well | . | . Other Demand Elasticities . The income elasticity of demand is the measure of how quantity demanded changes based on changes in income Formula: | Normal goods have positive income elasticities while inferior goods have negative ones | Engel’s Law stipulates: As a family’s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one. By contrast, luxuries such as jewelry and recreational goods tend to have large income elasticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their incomes are too low. | . | The cross-price elasticity of demand is the measure of how the quantity demanded changes based on price changes of another good Formula: | Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities while complement goods have negative ones | . | . 5-2: The Elasticity of Supply . The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of supply: how much the quantity supplied changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in supply in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Elasticity depends on how easy it is for sellers to change the quantity supplied Beachfront land is inelastic (cannot create more) but manufactured goods are elastic | . | Key determinant of price elasticity of supply is time period Supply is more elastic in the long run vs. short run, as firms cannot change the size of factories easily in a short period of time | Other changes, such as closing and opening, make products more elastic | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply . Formula for price elasticity of supply is defined as: | . The Variety of Supply Curves . On a graph, a slope closer to infinity is inelastic while a slope closer to 0 is elastic | . . 5-3: Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity . Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers? . Scenario: you are a wehat farmer who spends time making your land as productive as possible | New strand of wheat is found that increases wheat production by 20% | Because wheat (food) is an inelastic good, the total revenue falls when the quantity sold increases Farmers lose money, but they must use the new strand in order to remain competitive with other farmers | . | Affect of advancements in farming can be seen in the vast decrease in workers in the farm industry | Negative effect on farmers still has a positive effect on society; food is cheaper, more workers to do other things | . Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High? . Scenario: OPEC raised the price of oil to increase income From 1973 to 1974, oil prices raised 50%, and they continued to rise | . | OPEC was unable to maintain a high price of oil, and it went back down to low prices during the 90s | Can be explained by elasticities Oil is inelastic, and short term prices rose because people needed to buy oil | In the long term, non-OPEC countries found different ways to produce oil and oil consumption was made more efficient | . | Short term cuts to supply can lead to short term gains but will lose money in the long run | . . Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime? . Scenario: drug use is a serious problem, and the government tries to reduce the amount of drugs in the country | A raise in law enforcement for drugs reduces the quantity supplied for drugs Raises the price of drugs and reduces the quantity demanded for drugs | . | Demand for drugs remains inelastic (drug users will continue to want drugs), so drug users must pay more money for drugs which leads to crimes in order to obtain said money | Reducing demand for drugs can be more beneficial, as it will reduce both the price and quantity of drugs | Some argue that enforcing drug laws could be more beneficial to stopping drug crimes in the long run than in the short run, as goods become more elastic over time | . .",

The Republic at a glance . Plato described as a revolutionary, conservative, fascist, communist, practical reformer, and dreamer due to the book | Main idea is to show that one who is just is the best kind of person | Plato wants the reader to think about his ideas instead of taking them at face value | Does Plato believe that philosophers can be rulers? How realistic are his proposals about education meant to be? What is the point of the rulers’ theroretical knowledge, and how is it to be applied in practice? | Plato treads the line between practicality and theory; doesn’t want a theory to be bastardized, but also doesn’t support a theory which is impractical | .

What is Justice | Women, Family, Philosopher King, The Good, Higher Education, Dialectic, Curriculum | Degeneration of lives | Quarrel between philosophy and poetry | . Plato’s two world ontology and epistemology . Ontology (onto = “what is”) and epistemology (episteme = “knowledge”) . | Forms/Ideas - Ontology Ideas and forms are tangible objects, things that you can “see” with your intellect | Abstract, stable, perfect objects of cognition | Emphasis on knowledge; involves critical thinking and articulation | The concept of Beauty in the forms is indubitably good; factual | World of knowing, absolutes | . | Particulars - Epistemology Physical objects that are imperfect and mutable, things that you see with your eyes | A particular could be “beautiful”, but there are different beliefs about that Beliefs are formed around particulars but are erroneous | . | Beliefs involve isolated or loosely connected truths | True belief doesn’t involve this | . | . Why did Plato come up with the Forms . Wanted to find a solution to the political corruption of his day | A good person who can understand the world is spiritually ascending | Wants to expand the realm of philosophy; philosophers are just, and forms are necessary to understand the world | The Forms are a basis of a good person’s understanding | Wants his citizens to search for the truth by understanding the Forms | . The Sun and the Line: 2 analogies for the Platonic good . The Sun The sun provides light and growth in the physical world, allows us to see particulars | The good provides reality and truth to the intelligible world, allows us to know the Forms | The sun in the physical realm is like the good in the intelligible realm | The good makes it possible for objects of knowledge to be known by the mind, like the sun provides light | The good is the highest Form of knowledge | . | The Divided Line Lower half: physical reality illuminated by the sun 2 types of particulars Shadows, images, copies are linked to imagination, dreams, and fantasies | Physical objects are linked to beliefs | . | . | Upper half: intelligible reality illuminated by the Good 2 types of objects of knowledge Mathematics, science are linked ot understanding and reasoning | Forms are linked to rational intuition and intellection | . | . | Hard to cross the line from physical to intelligible reality | Lessons Separates lower and upper line | Getting from one point to another represents cognitive improvement | Emphasizes knowing things directly instead of indirectly (in images, shadows, etc.) | Mathematics is crucial in moving from the perceived world to the abstract | . | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand . 4-1: Markets and Competition . What is a Market? . Market: The buyers and sellers of a good or service Buyers determine demand, sellers determine demand | Markets can be organized or disorganized Crop market is organized; sellers meet together and determine how much supply there is while buyers gather and auction for goods | Smaller, local markets (say, ice cream) are unorganized; ice cream stores are not in contact with each other and buyers don’t meet | . | . | . What is Competition? . Prices are determined by the entire market, as everyone is competing with each other | Competitive Market: A market with enough participants (buyers and sellers) that no one individual has a significant impact on the market For this chapter, markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive; all sold goods are exactly the same, and there are enough buyers and sellers that no one can influence the market heavily | Buyers and sellers are price takers; they can buy and sell as much as they want but only at the market price | Easy entry and exit from the industry in the long-run | . | Many markets are (nearly) perfectly competitive, but some have only one seller, leading to a monopoly | . 4-2: Demand . The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded . Quantity Demanded: The amount of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to purchase Many factors can affect quantity demanded, but the assumed, simplified market will focus on one: price | Law of Demand: Considering everything else equal, price and demand are inverse; when price rises, demand lowers, and vice versa | Graphical representation: | Above table is an example of a demand schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded | The graph shown is known as the demand curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded; typically slopes downwards | . | . Market Demand versus Individual Demand . Market Demand is the sum of all of the individual demands for a good or service Example of creating a market demand curve from two individual demand curves: | . | . Shifts in the Demand Curve . Income Lower income means that a demand curve falls, as there is less money to spend | Normal good: A good whose demand falls when income falls | Inferior good: A good whose demand increases when income falls (such as public transportation) | . | Prices of Related Goods Substitutes: Two or more goods that are similar enough to be affected by each otehrs prices If the cost of ice cream goes down, then the demand for frozen yogurt goes down too (because froyo is more expensive and fairly similar) | . | Complements: Two or more goods that will go up or down in demand together depending on their prices If the price of tapioca pearls lowers, then the demand for both pearls and tea will increase | . | . | Tastes Depending on your tastes, you may buy more or less of a good/service; hard to explain and unscientific | . | Expectations What you expect to happen can affect your behavior; if you think a disaster will occur, you’re more willing to buy more survival goods and less willing to buy unnecessary goods | . | Number of Buyers Adding buyers increases demand and lowering buyers decreases demand | . | . 4-3: Supply . The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied . Quantity Supplied: The amount of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell A big determinant is price; when price of ice cream is high, the quantity supplied increases (because sellers want to make a higher profit) and vice versa | Law of Supply: Considering everything else equal, price and supply are related; when price rises, supply increases, and vice versa | Graphical Representation: | Above table is an example of a supply schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied | The graph shown is known as the supply curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity supply; typically slopes upwards | . | . Market Supply versus Individual Supply . Market supply is the sum of all individual supplies | . Shifts in the Supply Curve . Input Prices The price of the inputs to make a good/service (ingredients, machinery, manpower) affects the quantity supplied | Increase in input price lowers quantity supplied and vice versa | . | Technology Advancements in technology increases the quantity supplied because it becomes cheaper/faster to produce | . | Expectations A firm that expects the popularity of a good/service to rise may produce more of it, and vice versa | . | Number of sellers More sellers = more quantity supplied, and vice versa | . | . 4-4: Supply and Demand Together . Equilibrium . When a supply curve and demand curve are graphed together, there is a singular point of interception That point is called the equilibrium, with the price representing the equilibrium price and the quantity representing the equilibrium quantity | Equilibrium point is in perfect balance; the quantity and price is the same that the buyers demand and the sellers supply | . | Naturally, prices and quantity move towards the equilibrium point If there is too much supply compared to demand, then there is a surplus and sellers cannot sell their goods at the current price Sellers have too much supply; begin to cut prices, thus increasing demand, lowering prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | If there is too much demand compared to supply, then there is a shortage and buyers cannot buy the goods they want due to a lack of availability Sellers are enabled to raise prices, thus lowering demand, increasing prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | . | . . Theory of equilibrium leads to Law of Supply and Demand: the price of a good naturally adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance | . Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium . Must analyze events which affect equilibriums with three steps Does it change the supply curve, demand curve, or both? | Does it shift the curve to the left or right? | Compare the supply-and-demand diagrams to see how the shift affected the equilibrium point | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand One summer, it is more hot than usual Hot weather increases demand for ice cream but does not change supply curve | More demand shifts the demand curve to the right | Demand curve now meets the supply curve at a higher price and quantity | . | . | Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves In the last example, the actual supply curve didn’t move; instead, the equilibrium point moved upwards along the curve | A shift in the supply/demand curve is called a “change” while a movement along the supply/demand curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied/demanded” | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply One summer, a hurricane destroys a sugarcane crop, increasing the price of sugar Raise in input costs leads to a reduction in the amount of ice cream produced | Less supply shifts the supply curve to the left | There is now a shortage of ice cream, and the equilibrium point moves left along the demand curve | . | . | Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand Let’s say that the hot weather and hurricane occurred in the same summer Both curves shift; the demand increases because of the heat, and the supply decreases because of a higher input cost | Demand curve shifts to the right, and supply curve shifts to the left | Depending on the size of the shifts, there are two possible outcomes, but both result in an increase in equilibrium price | . | . | . . Discussion Notes: Price typically falls on the y axis, and quantity falls on the x axis | Total revenue (p x q) follows a parabolic shape (goes up, plateaus, then goes down) | Elasticity: The change in price divided by the change in quantity; %deltaQ/%deltaP Typically calculated using derivatives, but can use a midpoint formula ∣Q2−Q1(Q1+Q2)/2P2−P1(P1+P2)/2∣| { {Q_2 - Q_1 over (Q_1 + Q_2) / 2} over {P_2 - P_1 over (P_1 + P_2) / 2} } |∣(P1​+P2​)/2P2​−P1​​(Q1​+Q2​)/2Q2​−Q1​​​∣ | . | Unit elastic is when your elasticity is equal to 1; over 1 is elastic, and under 1 is inelastic | Goods with substitutes are usually elastic, while necessities are inelastic | Decrease in price of an elastic good will increase revenue, while a decrease in price of an inelastic good will decrease revenue | . | . | .",

            "content": "1.6: Predicates and quantifiers . Predicate: A statement whose truth value depends on one or more variables, even if the outcome is predetermined Represented as a function; “P of x” | Ex: “x is an even number” would be true if x = 4, but not if x = 5 | Domain: All of the possible values of x for a predicate “x is an even number” would have a domain of all natural numbers | If not apparent from context, should be defined in the predicate | . | Predicates do not have to be strictly mathematical; general statements can be turned into predicates as well | . | Universal quantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∀ which reads as “for all” ∀x P(x) reads as “for every x, P(x)” and is a proposition that only returns true if every x in the domain is true ∀x P(x) is a universally quantified statement | . | Proof showing that a universally quantified statement is true: . | Counterexample: An element in the domain of a universally quantified statement that is false; used to prove that a statement is false | . | Existensial equantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∃ which reads as “there exists” ∃x P(x) reads as “there exists an x, such that P(x)” and is a proposition that returns true if any x in the domain is true ∃x P(x) is an existentially quantified statement | . | Example: An element in the domain of a existentially quantified statement that is true; used to prove that a statement is true | Proof showing that an existentially quantified statement is false: | . | . . 1.7: Quantified statements . Can combine quantifiers and logical expressions to create quantified statements Example: Let P(x) = x is prime and O(x) = x is odd; ∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬O(x)) states that there exists a positive number that is prime and not odd | . | A free variable is defined as a variable that can be any value in the domain, while a bound variable is defined as a variable that is bound to a quantifier x in P(x) is a free variable, while x in ∃x P(x) is a bound variable | A statement is a proposition if it contains no free variables | . | Can express quantified statements in English Let P(x) = x came to the party and S(x) = x was sick | ∃x (S(x) ∨ P(x)) is true because Joe satisfies the proposition: S(Joe) ∨ P(Joe) == True | . | . Name S(x) P(x) . Joe | F | T | . Theodore | T | F | . Gertrude | F | T | . Samuel | F | F | . If there are no values in the domain/set, then a universally quantified statement is vacuously true and a existentially quantified statement is false | . . 1.8: De Morgan’s law for quantified statements . ¬∀x F(x) can be rewritten as ∃x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∀x F(x) ≡ ∃x ¬F(x) Ex: “Not every bird can fly” == “There exists a bird that cannot fly” | . | Likewise, ¬∃x F(x) can be rewritten as ∀x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∃x F(x) ≡ ∀x ¬F(x) Ex: “There does not exist a bird that can fly” == “Every bird cannot fly” | . | When simplifying a quantifier, make sure to use a double negation on it Example: | . | . . 1.9: Nested quantifiers . When there are multiple variables in a predicate, you must use multiple, nested quantifiers Examples of nested quantifiers: | . | Propositions with multiple variables can be thought of as pairs Take ∀x ∀y M(x, y); this proposition is false if there is ANY pair of x, y that does not satisfy M(x, y) (including if x and y are the same) | For ∃x ∃y M(x, y), the proposition is false if ALL pairs of x, y are not true for M(x, y) (also including if x and y are the same) | . | If a quantified statement has two quantifiers (one existential (∃) and one universal (∀)), it’s effective to think of the statement as a two player game The existential player (variable) tries to make the expression true, while the universal player (variable) tries to make the expression false | The player (variable) on the left goes first, and the next player (variable) tries their best to succeed in their goal | Ex: In ∀x ∃y (x + y = 0), x goes first and chooses a random value; y tries its best to set x + y = 0 and is successful because it can always become -x | . | DeMorgan’s can be applied to nested quantifiers as well; it switches the signs of the quantifier to its opposite | . . . 1.10: More nested quantified statements . If you want to express ∀x ∀y without including situations where x == y, then you can write the proposition as ∀x ∀y ((x ≠ y) → M(x, y)) If x == y, then x, y cannot be used as a counter example because it’s not false | . | To express uniqueness, you can use a combination of nested quantifiers and conditionals | . . You can also move the quantifiers depending on where it is located in the statement | . . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.10.1 is good practice . . 1.11: Logical reasoning . Argument: A sequence of propsitions (AKA hypotheses) that is followed by a final proposition (AKA conclusion) Valid arguments have true conclusions when all hypotheses are true; invalid otherwise | ∴ symbol denotes “therefore” | Commutative law allows hypotheses to be in any order . | Ex: These two arguments are the same | Proving an arguments validity via truth table: . | You can prove that an argument is invalid by showing an example where the hypotheses are true but the conclusion is not | . | An argument’s form is found by replacing propositions with variables Ex: “It is raining today. + If it is raining today, I will not ride my bike to school. ∴ I will not ride my bike to school.” can be replaced with “p + (p –&gt; q) ∴ q” | Forms can be useful because it can invalidate an argument with known truth values Ex: | . | . | If an argument does not have an assignment where the hypotheses are true, then the argument is valid | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.11.1 is good practice . Questions: . What is the difference between (x != y) -&gt; and (x != y) ^? Is it because ^ is for existentials and -&gt; is for universals? .",

            "title": "Principles of Economics Ch. 1-3",
            "content": "Chapter 1: Ten Principles of Economics . By nature, resources are scarce, meaning that they are limited and not everyone can get whatever they want | Economics: study of how society manages its resources No one person controls all of the resources; every individual has a say in how a resource is distributed | Economists study how people make decisions based on resources (work, purchases, savings, etc.) | Economists also study larger forces/trends such as unemployment, income growth, inflation, etc. | . | . 1-1: How People Make Decisions . Summary: People make decisions based on what they have to give (opportunity cost) and comparing it to what they get. Rational people try to get the best outcome possible and use marginal changes to get the most out of their resources. Rational people also consider the costs and benefits of a purchase/behaving a certain way. . Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs . Most decisions require trade-offs; give something you like to get something you like | Types of trade-offs in society “Guns and butter”: The more spent on military/defense (guns), the less spent on quality of life goods (butter) Relates to trade-off between clean environment and high income; costs more for a factory to produce goods cleanly, so they might have to provide lower wages, charge higher prices, etc. | . | Efficiency and equality: getting the most out of a society’s resources vs. giving out products equally amongst members of the society (respectively) “Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices” | Efficiency and equality conflict with each other; giving poor people money (equality+) means that people may not work as hard and production goes down (efficiency-) | . | Trade-offs are key to understanding economics, as people try to make trade-offs most beneficial to them | . | . Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It . Opportunity cost: Everything you give up to get an item, including time, health, money, etc. Ex. Many athletes believe that spending 4 years in college has too high of an opportunity cost compared to going straight to a pro league | . | . Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin . Economy assumes people are rational, or that they try their hardest to get the best outcome | Decisions are not black and white (buy a 3m$ house or be homeless?), so rational people use marginal change to slowly adjust their plans in order to get the best result Marginal costs should be taken into account when making decisions | Ex. It’s free to watch another movie if you’ve already paid for a monthly subscription, or an airline can seat another person if they have empty seats; both marginal costs are zero | . | A classic example is “a cup of water vs. a diamond”; marginally, getting one more cup of water is much easier than getting a(nother) diamond, so water costs less | Rational decisions are ones where the marginal benefit (gaining one more unit) is greater than the marginal cost (how much does that extra unit cost?) | . Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives . Incentive: Something that encourages a person to act Ex. If apple prices rise, then consumers will buy fewer apples and producers will produce more apples | Public policymakers use incentives to affect the behaviors of citizens; taxing cigarettes causes less people to smoke | Incentives often affect cost-benefit calculations and must be taken into consideration | . | . 1-2: How People Interact . Summary: People trade in order to maximize their production, as trade allows for specialization. Markets facilitate trade, and governments often step in to ensure that the market runs smoothly. . Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off . Competition and trading can benefit all parties Each person trades goods (work, most commonly) for other goods (food, homes, cars, etc.); competitive pricing forces goods to have low prices, benefiting consumers | Not participating in trade/competition means that people would have to grow their own food, build their own house, etc. | Trading allows for specialization and more advanced societies | . | . Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity . Communism was founded on principle that the government should control the economy (central planning) AKA Command Economy | Most countries that had central planning stopped using it in favor of a market economy | Government decides on the producers, the level of output, the consumers; pretty much everything | . | Market Economy: an economy that is based on the decisions of individual households, companies, firms, etc. to exchange goods and services; decisions are made based on whatever is the most profitable/whatever provides the best outcome Can seem dangerous (no governing authority to ensure equality), but people make decisions as if guided by “an invisible hand (Adam Smith) | Prices are the main way the economy is controlled; determines the demand from buyers and the supply from sellers, thus displaying the value of a product to society | When a government interrupts the forces of natural supply and demand, the decisions of individuals don’t follow the invisible hand as much Shows why communism failed: prices didn’t change to reflect the true values of products | Leads to excesses and shortages because the government doesn’t know how much demand there is | . | Products such as Uber show the inner workings of market economies | . | . Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes . Governments are necessary to enforce rules that are important to a market economy These rules include property rights; individuals must be able to own and control their resources freely | . | Governments also choose whether or not to promote efficiency or equality Occasionally, a market failure occurs where a free market is inefficient in its distribution of resources; government must step in to make it efficient Can be caused by externality: the actions of one affects the health/well-being of another (such as pollution) Can negatively or positively affect consumption and production | Examples include smoking cigarettes, pollution, education, or a bee farm next to an orange orchard | . | Can also be caused by market power: one (or a few) person(s) or group(s) control a resource and can unnaturally change its price due to its necessity | Asymmetric Information: one party has more information than another; can lie and be dishonest with a price Adverse Selection: Market failure where products of lower quality are sold at the same price as those of higher quality; too many low quality products are sold | Moral Hazard: When a party can change their behavior without taking on risk, typically in the form of insurance | . | . | Free markets can cause large wealth disparities and inequalities; government can step in and provide basic goods + welfare for those at the bottom of the economic ladder | . | Public policy not always perfect; can be corrupted or abused | . 1-3: How the Economy as a Whole Works . Summary: Countries that are able to produce more goods and services have a higher standard of living. Printing can stimulate an economy, leading to the hiring of more workers, but it can also lead to higher inflation. Often, printing money (or the lack thereof) causes random business cycles. . Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services . Different countries have different qualities of life and average incomes; higher income == higher quality of life This difference relies on a countries’ productivity, or the goods/services output per unit of work input | Countries with higher productivities generally have a higher standard of living than countries with lower productivities This relationship means that other factors are far less important in determining standard of living | . | Policy makers must create policy based on increasing productivity | . | . Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money . Inflation: A rise in prices across an economy Inflation typically occurs because governments print money; more money –&gt; money is less valuable –&gt; prices increase | . | . Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment . Printing money stimulates the economy, causes companies to hire more people, and increases production BUT it causes higher prices in the long term Leads to business cycles: large, irregular, and unpredictable changes in economic activity | Government spending, printing, and taxing can all affect inflation, productivity, and more - it’s up for debate how much (if at all) the government should do | . | . . Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist . 2-1: The Economist as Scientist . Summary: Economists can act as a scientist in the sense that they create hypotheses in order to understand more about the field. They must make assumptions in order to form these hypotheses/conclusions. There are many models to represent an economy. There are two studies of economics: micro and macro. . The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation . Newton first observed an apple fall, created a theory about gravity, and observed to see if his theory was correct; this method can be applied to economics Ex. An economist could theorize that inflation and high prices were related, then gather data from countries and see if his theory is correct | . | Difference between traditional sciences and economics is that economics cannot create controlled experiments; they must make do with real world data Historical events often provide the best study cases for how a key resource affects an economy, such as wars in the Middle East | . | . The Role of Assumptions . Economists must make assumptions in order to simplify complex situations and clarify them Ex. Breaking down a complicated problem (analyzing international trade) into smaller parts (analyze trade between two countries and with two products) to better understand the concepts | . | The elegance of economics is deciding what assumptions to use Ex. When studying effects of inflation on price, you could assume that short term prices will stay similar while long term prices will fluctuate greatly | . | . Economic Models . Models often omit details to show what is really important and are built with assumptions | . Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram . Circular-flow diagram is used to show how groups in an economy interact with each other | In the diagram, households (consumers) and firms (producers) participate in two markets Markets for goods and services are ones where households buy the products of firms | Markets for the factors of production are ones where households provide input (labor, money, etc.) to firms for the firms to create goods and services | . | Inner loop represents the flow of inputs (labor, land, capital) and outputs (goods and services) | Outer loop represents the flow of dollars/money; paying wages, buying goods, etc. | Circular-flow diagram is good to understand how different parts of the economy interact | Assumed that there is no government intervention, foreign trade | . Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier . Most economic models are built using mathematics | The production possibilities frontier is a graph that displays the different levels of output for two goods (assuming that an economy only produces those two goods) | The outermost line represents the maximum efficiency of the economy (efficient combinations lie on this line); can only produce that many products given its resources Any points outside of the border (such as point C) cannot be reached in the current state of the economy | Any points inside of the border but not on the line (such as point D) are deemd inefficient because they don’t use the maximum amount of resources | . | The graph relates to both trade-offs and opportunity costs Trade-off between producing more/less of one product than the other | Opportunity cost is depends on the slope of the frontier; lower slope = lower opportunity cost, steeper slope = higher opportunity cost | . | Econoomists believe that production possibilities frontiers will generally have a curved shape Ex. If all of an economy’s resources (including car makers) are being used to make computers, then making one car will barely inhibit computer production and vice verse; leads to different slopes at the ends | . | Frontiers can shift depending on economic growth or change | The frontier establishes scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and growth; good model for demonstrating economics | . Microeconomics and Macroeconomics . Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms interact with each other and make decisions on a small scale (in one market, for example) | Macroeconomics: The study of how things can affect an entire economy | Both are tied to each other; impossible to understand macroeconomic concepts without knowing microeconomic ones Both fields are still very different, warranting different courses | . | . 2-2: The Economist as Policy Advisor . Summary: Economists can make either positive or normative statements. Policymakers listen to these statements and form laws based on the advice, though economists are not always listened to. . Positive versus Normative Analysis . A positive statement is objective and makes a statement about how the world is | A normative statement is subjective and makes a statement about how the world should be | Positive statements can be analyzed, rationed with, and (dis)proven, while normative statements must be evaluated using both facts and moral values | . Economists in Washington . Economists must describe both options to policy makers in order for them to make a well-informed decision | Economists give advice, formulate plans, design tax policy, analyze data, evalutate public policy, provide new insight through research and publications, and more | . Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed . Economic policy, in practice, cannot be enforced as it would be in theory | Lawmakers must appeal to the masses (as well as Congress) and change portions of suggested economic policy in order to do so | . 2-3: Why Economists Disagree . Summary: Economists disagree on issues because they have different values and may interpret data differently. However, there are many “controversial” issues that economists typically agree on. . Differences in Scientific Judgments . Economists are always trying to understand world economies, so they might disagree if they interpret certain discoveries differently This includes controversial concepts like supply-side economics and welfare | . | . Differences in Values . Economists may disagree on the “fairness” of policies based on their values or upbringings | . Perception versus Reality . Economists agree on many propositions that may be more controversial to the public, such as rent control and enforcing tariffs Despite the fact that economists agree, if politicans were to implement such policies (like rent control), they might not get reelected/lose popularity, thus causing contradictions between public policy and agreed upon propositions | . | . . Chapter 3: Interdependence and the Gains from Trade . 3-1: A Parable for the Modern Economy . Summary: Trade can benefit both parties even if one party is absolutely better than the other at producing a certain good. Trade allows for specialization. . Scenario: Let’s say there are two people, Ruby and Frank, and two goods, beef and potatoes Ruby can only produce beef and Frank can only produce potatoes | Both parties would benefit from trading with each other, as they would have more variety in their diets (beef + potatoes vs. only beef or only potatoes) | Can also trade other things; if Ruby can’t farm potatoes well and Frank can’t raise cattle, then they could trade farms | . | Guiding Question: What if one person is better at producing every good? | . Production Possibilities . Assuming that Frank and Ruby could work 8 hours a day, they can only devote so much time to raising cattle or growing potatoes | Production possibilities frontier for both farmers: These frontiers are not curved (or “bowed-out”) because each farmer’s efficiency remains the same regardless the amount of time spent on either task | . | The frontiers show us what would happen if both farmers were self sufficient and are good at displaying the trade-offs they make, but aren’t effective at showing what decisions they would make | . Specialization and Trade . Ruby tells Frank to spend all of his time farming potatoes (which he is more efficient at) | Ruby spends more of her time farming cattle (which she is better at than Frank) and some of her time growing potatoes | By specializing and trading their specialized goods, both farmers benefit and consume more of both foods | . 3-2: Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization** . Summary: Comparative advantage determines how trade is conducted; if both parties have a comparative advantage over one another, then they can export the good that they are more efficient in producing. For both parties to benefit, the price of trade should be between their opportunity costs. . Absolute Advantage . Absolute advantage is used to compare two firms, countries, people, etc.; one group has an absolute advantage if they use less inputs for the same output Ruby takes 20 minutes to make an ounce of meat and 10 minutes to make an ounce of potatoes, while Frank takes 60 and 15 minutes, respectively; Ruby has an absolute advantage over Frank | . | . Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage . In this scenario, opportunity cost represents the trade-off in time between producing meat and potatoes Ruby can make 2 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; her opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/2 ounce of meat | Frank can make 4 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; his opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/4 ounce of meat | . | Comparative advantage: Having a lower opportunity cost to produce a good compared to another producer Despite Frank being worse at producing both goods, he has a comparative advantage over Ruby because 1/4 &lt; 1/2 | One person cannot have a comparative advantage in both goods because the comparative advantages are inverse; if you have a low opportunity cost for one good, it’ll be higher for the other good | . | . Comparative Advantage and Trade . When people specialize in producing a good that they have a comparative advantage in, the total production of the economy rises, making everyone better off | By trading, people can obtain goods at a lower opportunity cost and therefore get more net goods | . The Price of Trade . To determine the price at which parties trade at, a general rule can be applied: For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between their opportunity costs Frank and Ruby trade at a price of 3 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat; Ruby’s opportunity cost is 2 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat and Frank’s is 4 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat | Any price between 2 and 4 would benefit both parties If below 2, then both parties would want to buy meat because it’s cheaper than their opportunity cost; if above 4, then both parties would want to sell meat because the price is higher than their opportunity cost | . | . | . 3-3: Applications of Comparative Advantage . Summary: Examples of how comparative advantages apply to the real world. . Should LeBron James Mow His Own Lawn? . James is a great athlete, but the time he wastes on mowing his lawn could be used on other things such as recording a commercial or otherwise Regular people have a comparative advantage over James, so James should hire people to mow his lawn for him (and compensate them at a price that is higher than their opportunity cost) | . | . Should the United States Trade with Other Countries? . Goods bought from abroad are called imports and goods sold to other countries are exports | If one country is more adept at producing a certain good compared to another country, then they should export that good while importing a good that said other country has a comparative advantage in | Trade can benefit both parties, but it may hurt individuals; importing cars and exporting farmed goods affects autoworkers and farmers differently | .",

Conditional operations are represented with the symbol → p → q is read as “if p then q” | Truth table: | Think of it as a contract; if condition one is fulfilled, then the second condition HAS to be fulfilled, but if condition one is not fulfilled, then the second condition can either be fulfilled or not. | Different ways to express conditional operations: | p only if q is also p → q; most confusing one | . | Related conditional statements include the contrapositive, converse, and inverse The converse of p → q is q → p | The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p | The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q | . | Biconditional operations are represented with ↔ p ↔ q stands for “p if and only if q” - AKA true if p == q and false if not | If and only if can be represented with iff | . | Conditional and biconditional operations can be used in conjunction with other operations ∧, ∨, and ¬ takes precedence before → or ↔ | . | . . 1.4 Logical equivalence . A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, while a contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false p ∨ ¬p is a tautology, while p ∧ ¬p is a contradiction | . | Logical equivalence means that two compound propositions always return the same value ≡ is used to denote logical equivalence | If s ≡ r, then s ↔ r is a tautology, and s ≡ r if and only if r ≡ s | . | De Morgan’s Laws are laws that use logical equivalences to show how to distribute negation, or NOT, operations First version of the law: ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q) or !(p or q) == !p and !q | Second version of the law: ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) or !(p and q) == !p or !q | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.4.1 is a great capstone activity for practice . . 1.5 Laws of propositional logic . You can substitute a proposition in for another one if both propositions are logically equivalent ex: Because p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q, (p ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ≡ (p ∨ r) ∧ (p → q) | Useful laws for logical equivalence: | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activities 1.5.1-1.5.3 are great practice activities .",
