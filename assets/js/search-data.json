Examples:dxdt+x=2cos(t)d2xdt2+dxdt−x=0 text{Examples:} frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 cos(t) frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + frac{dx}{dt} - x = 0Examples:dtdx​+x=2cos(t)dt2d2x​+dtdx​−x=0 . In these examples, x is dependent on t; can be considered a function. On the other hand, t is an independent variable. Differential equations can also include parameters which are constants/coefficients. . Is x=cost+sint a solution to dxdt+x=2cost?dxdt+x=ddt(cost+sint)+cost+sint=(−sint+cost)+cost+sint=2costThus, x is a solution to the equation, and there are many other x that are solutions as well. text{Is } x = cost + sint text{ a solution to } frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 cost text{?} frac{dx}{dt} + x = frac{d}{dt} (cost + sint) + cost + sint = (-sint + cost) + cost + sint = 2cost text{Thus, x is a solution to the equation, and there are many other x that are solutions as well.}Is x=cost+sint a solution to dtdx​+x=2cost?dtdx​+x=dtd​(cost+sint)+cost+sint=(−sint+cost)+cost+sint=2costThus, x is a solution to the equation, and there are many other x that are solutions as well. . Ordinary differential equation: A differential equation with only one independent varialbe $ frac{dx}{dt} = sin x$ | . | Partial differential equation: A differential equation with several independent variables, using partial derivatives $ frac{ partial u}{ partial x} + frac{ partial u}{ partial y} + frac{ partial u}{ partial z} = 1$ | . | Linearity: An equation is linear if and only if the dependent variables and their derivatives appear linearly Linear: $ frac{dx}{dt} + t = 0 text{ and } frac{dx}{dt} + sin t = 0$ | Nonlinear: $e^{dx / dt} = 0 text{ and } e^x frac{dx}{dt} + t = 0$ | . | Homogeneity: A linear equation is homogeneous if all terms depend on the dependent variable. Otherwise, it is non- or inhomogeneous Homogeneous: $ frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + e^t frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0$ | Inhomogeneous: $ frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 2 frac{dx}{dt} + t = 0$ | . | Constant Coefficients: A linear equation has constant coefficients if the coefficients are all constants (except for the inhomogeneity) Example: $5 frac{d^3x}{dt^3} + 4 frac{dx}{dt} + sin(t)cos(t) = 0$ | . | Autonomy: An equation is autonomous if the equation does not depend on the independent variable at all Autonomous: $e^x frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0$ | Not autonomous: $ frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + sint = 0$ | . | . Solving First Order ODEs . Case 1: f only depends on x . Given an equation like y′=f(x), we can use the anti-derivative to solve.∫y′dx=∫f(x)dxy(x)=∫f(x)dx+CWe can get rid of the constant given an initial value for y(c) where c is some constant; known as an IVP. text{Given an equation like } y&amp;#x27; = f(x) text{, we can use the anti-derivative to solve.} int y&amp;#x27;dx = int f(x)dx y(x) = int f(x)dx + C text{We can get rid of the constant given an initial value for y(c) where c is some constant; known as an IVP.}Given an equation like y′=f(x), we can use the anti-derivative to solve.∫y′dx=∫f(x)dxy(x)=∫f(x)dx+CWe can get rid of the constant given an initial value for y(c) where c is some constant; known as an IVP. . Case 2: f only depends on y . Equation: y′=f(y)Note that y′=dydx=f(y). Therefore:dydx=f(y)→dxdy=1f(y)Then, we can use the same method as Case 1, but we set x as the dependent variable and then solve for y. text{Equation: } y&amp;#x27; = f(y) text{Note that } y&amp;#x27; = frac{dy}{dx} = f(y) text{.

Option: A contract that allows you to purchase some product at a specified value at the expiration date | Strike price: The cost of purchasing an option at the current moment | Owning the option allows you to take an action; should always cost something Owning an option is known as being long, and the cost of an option is calld a premium | . | Selling an option means you sell the rights to a counterparty and must allow them to exercise their action Selling an option is known as being short | . | Options are derivative securities, as they derive their values from the prices of other securities like stocks, gold, or oil | Call Option $C_E (S)$ A long call option is the right to buy an asset S at an agreed value E (aka the strike or exercise price) at a future date | . | Put Option $P_E (S)$ A long put option is the right to sell an asset S at an agreed value E on a future date | . | Four types of options: long put, short put, long call, short call Linear combinations of puts and calls can be created for custom payoff structures | . | Options are defined by the strike/exercise price E, expiration date, and exercise style American style: can be exercised any time before expiration | European style: can be exercised only at expiration | . | Options can be in/at/out of the money depending on S compared to E | . Values at Expiration . For a long call, its value at expiration is $max(0, S-E)$ If the asset price is less than the strike price, then the option is worthless | Any difference in strike and asset price is profit, adds value to the option | . | . . For a short call, you only get the profit of the strike price and incur a loss depending on the asset value | . . For a long put, you are given the option of selling a stock S at the strike price E; you want the stock S to go down in price in order to make profit | . . For a short put, you want the stock price to go up; risk is bounded at -E | . . You can put together puts and calls to make portfolios and minimize risk | . Put-Call Parity . Basic compounding equation $P_{t + n} = (1 + r)^n P_t$ | . | Compounding equation where interest compounds M times per year $P_{final} = (1 + r/M)^M P_0$ | $ lim_{M rightarrow infty} (1 + r/M)^M = e^r$ Derived from the fact that $ lim_{n rightarrow infty} (1 + 1/n)^n = e$ | . | Continuous compounding is better for modeling compared to discrete modeling | Final compounding model: $P_{final} = e^{rt} P_0$, where r is the APR and t is the number of years | Present value of money: $P_0 = P_{final} e^{-rt}$ | . | Value of money over time $ Delta M(t) = r M(t) Delta t rightarrow sum frac{ Delta M}{M} = r sum Delta t$ | As the change in t goes to 0, the equation becomes $ int frac{1}{M} dM = r int dt$ | If $E = M(T = t)$, then $ int_{M(T)}^E frac{1}{M} dM = r int_{t}^T dt rightarrow M(t) = Ee^{-r(T - t)}$ | . | Put-Call Parity Equation | .

            "content": "Graph Representation . Want the following out of a graph data structure: - Count vertices: O(1) - Iterate through all vertices: O(1) per vertex - Associate information with vertices: O(1) per get/set - Iterate through all edges: O(1) per edge - Get degree of vertex: O(1) - Count all edges: O(1) - Iterate through edges in/out of a vertex: O(1) per edge - Associate information with edges: O(1) per get/set - Test whether two vertices are connected by an edge: O(1) . Decorator Pattern and Adjacency Lists . Possible solutions: . Dictionary, with vertices as keys | Number vertices and index an array using those numbers | Separate variables for vertex objects for each piece of information | One dictionary varialbe per vertex with keys for each piece of information | An adjacency list uses a dictionary of vertices as keys and the list of outgoing neighbors as values There are lots of different variations on this structure; different objects for vertices and edges | . | The Python-style dictionary representation satisfies the time constraints needed for an efficient PageRank algorithm Some operations are not supported; e.g. looping through incoming edges can be slow | . | . BFS/DFS . Implicit graph: A graph whose edges and vertices are not already given and must be found through an algorithm (like BFS) | A path is an alternating sequence of endpoints and edges that does not allow repetition | A walk is the same as a path but allows repetition | Reachability: Does there exist a path between two nodes? If so, then they are reachable from each other | . Minimum Spanning Trees . Given an undirected graph, find a tree that connects all vertices and minimizes the total weight | Disconnected graphs will output a spanning forest as opposed to a tree | Minimize and maximize are the same problem; simply make weights negative | . Applications . Build an optimal power grid/transportation routes with minimal total construction cost | Build a computer network with maximum badwidth - maximum spanning tree | The minimum spanning tree has the smallest possible bottle neck out of all trees; maximum has the largest | . Properties . Assumes that there are no “tied” edges, and if they do have the same edge, then use a consistent tiebreaking method | Cycle property: If C is a cycle in the original graph G, then the heaviest edge in this cycle cannot be in the MST In other words: If C is any cycle and e is its heaviest edge, then an MST that contains e will not be the MST | . | Cut property: If we cut the vertices of the graph into any two subsets of vertices X and G - X, and e is the lihtest edge with endpoints in both subsets, then e must be in the MST Can be used to derive algorithms | . | Path property: For any two vertices x and y, the MST path from x to y has the minimum possible weight for its heaviest edge | . Algorithms . Most algorithms to find an MST takes O(n log n) time and utilize the cut property | Algorithms have been found that take close to linear time or expected linear time but randomized | . Jarnik’s Algorithm (Prim-Dijkstra) . Start with some vertex S; this will be the start of the MST, named T | Repeat until T contains all vertices: Partition the graph into T and G - T | Find the minimum-weight edge e connecting T and G - T | Add e to T (as well as its corresponding vertex) | | Can be implemented via a priority queue Store vertices not yet in T by the weight of the minimum-weight edge that would connect it to T | Update the priority queue each time you update T by looping through the edges | . | Using a binary heap, all find/remove operations take O(log n) time, so the total time is O(m log n) because each edge is looped over twice | A Fibonacci heap can get this down to O(m + n log n) | . Kruskal’s Algorithm . Start by creating a forest of one-vertex trees | Sort the edges by weight | For each edge, if it connects two different trees, conenct the trees and add the edge to the MST | O(m log m) for sorting, O(m) to iterate through list; O(m log m) total | Can use the union-find data structure for near-constant lookups of forests | . Boruvka’s Algorithm (Sollin) . Start by creating a forest of one-vertex trees | Label vertices by their tree | While there is more than one tree, find the minimum-weight outgoing edge from each forest Add all of these minimum-weight edges to the T and connect the forests using them | . | The number of trees will go down by a factor of 2 or more, so we will do this iteration log n times | Looping through all m edges per iteration means the runtime is O(m log n) | . Hybrid Algorithm . Run Boruvka’s algorithm until the number of trees is less than or equal to n / log n | Run Jarnik’s algorithm with Fiboniacci heaps, using a priority queue on the trees as opposed to the vertices | O(m log log n) from Boruvka and O(m) from Jarnik means that the total runtime is O(m log log n) | . Topological Ordering . Topological ordering: A list of all vertices in G such that, for every edge $x rightarrow y$, x is before y in the list | Topological sorting: An algorithm to compute a topological ordering | Graphs that have cycles cannot have a topological ordering Thus, only directed acyclic graphs can have a topological ordering | . | Can use a simple greedy algorithm; add vertices with no incoming edges to the ordering, and remove its outgoing edges from the graph If there is ever a point where there are no “ready” vertices but there are still vertices left to process, then there is a cycle | To find the cycle: go to a remaining vertex and walk forward until a vertex is repeated; the sequence between the repititions is the cycle | . | . Shortest and Longest Paths . Shortest path can found by BFS; longest path is NP-hard because it includes finding a Hamiltonian path When there exists negative paths, then shortest path is NP-hard | . | Shortest walk is not possible if the graph has a negative cycle; can keep walking around the cycle and reducing total weight | For finding shortest paths in directed graphs: If graph is DAG, use topological ordering (O(m)) | If graph has nonnegative edge lengths, use Dijkstra’s (close to linear time) Works on undirected graphs | . | If graph has negative edges but no negative cycle, use Bellman-Ford algorithm (O(mn)) Can also detect negative cycles if one exists | . | Bellman-Ford is optimal and can be improved based on recent results | Dijkstra’s is “universally optimal” for a fixed graph with variable, positive weights | . | . Critical Path Scheduling (PERT method) . Input: a project consisting of multiple tasks that take different amounts of time | Some tasks can be done simultaneously; others rely on earlier tasks to be completed | Goal: Find a schedule for the tasks that finishes the project in the lowest possible time AKA longest path finder | . | Can use an activity-on-edge graph; tasks are converted to edges, and vertices are project milestones Constraints are represented by directed edges and have zero weight | The critical path is the longest path in this graph from start to end and is the minimum possible time for the schedule | Assign times to vertices by making sure that the difference between stages is greater than or equal to the length of the edge between them | . | To calculate the optimal schedule, we can use a topological ordering Set the path length of the starting vertex to 0 | Find the largest incoming edge $u rightarrow v$ and set the path length of v to $L(u) + weight(u rightarrow v)$ | . | Can find the smallest incoming edge to get the shortest paths | . Shortest Path Trees and Relaxation Algorithms . In graphs without negative cycles, we can generate a tree of shortest paths | If s is the startest vertex, then other vertices will have parents are the vertices that come before them their shortest path e.g. if the shortest path from x to c is $x rightarrow b rightarrow c$, then b is a parent of c in the tree | . | Input: A graph with edge lengths and a starting vertex | Output: Tree of shortest paths from s to all other reachable vertices Two decorations per vertex: the parent and distance from start vertex | . | General idea: use the two decorations and update them when shorter paths are found | Invariants D is the length of some path to x that is greater than or equal to the correct value | P is the second-to-last vertex on a path of length ≤D | . | Initialize by setting P(x) = None and D(x) = 0 if the vertex is s; otherwise D(x) = infinity | For each edge uv, check whether the distance to u + the length of uv is less than the current shortest path for v, then update if so | If the graph is a DAG: Simple algorithm is to go through vertices in topological order and relaxing each vertices edges | Total time is O(m) | . | . initialize D, P for v in topological order: for incoming edges uv: relax(u, v) . Bellman-Ford Algorithm . Uses relaxation paradigm and takes O(mn) times | . initialize D, P repeat n-1 times: for each edge uv in the whole graph: relax(u, v) . Can be improved based on ordering of nodes or stopping early; still results in same big O | . Dijkstra’s Algorithm . Topologically sorts the shortest path tree by sorting vertices by distance Uses a priority queue to order on the fly | . | . initialize D, P make priority queue Q of vertices, prioritized by D[v] while Q is non-empty: find and remove minimum-priority vertex v in Q for each edge vw: relax(vw) . Takes O(m log n) with a binary heap or O(m + n log n) with a Fibonacci heap | . Changing Weights without Changing Optimum Paths . We can add another decoration to the edges, a height h(x), to reweight the edges | Each edge has two properties: length and height New length: $l_h(u rightarrow v) = l(u rightarrow v) - h(u) + h(v)$ | Downhill edges have decreased length, uphill edges have increased length | . | Heights can eliminate negative edges and allow Dijkstra’s to work Can now use Johnson’s and Suurballe’s algorithm | Won’t get rid of negative cycles | . | Can also change the order of computation A* algorithm uses this fact | . | . Johnson’s Algorithm . Input: A graph G with negative edges but not negative cycles | Output: Shortest paths between all pairs of vertices | . Add a start vertex s that is connected to all other vertices by zero-weight edges | Use Bellman-Ford only once to compute the shortest paths from s to all other vertices | Reweight using the absolute value of distance from s as the height (guarantees that all edges are non-negative) | Use Dijkstra from each starting vertex in the reweighted graph | BF takes O(mn), reweighting takes linear time, Dijkstra is run n times; $O(mn + n^2 text{log } n)$ time | . Suurballe’s Algorithm . Input: A weighted directed graph and two endpoint vertices, s and t | Output: Find two paths from s to t such that the paths don’t share edges and minimize the sum of the length of both | Can find two shortest paths by finding one shortest path, then adding “reverse” edges with negative weights from the first shortest path If both shortest paths take the same edge, then the edge will be cancelled out | . | . Use Dijkstra to find single-source paths and distances from s | Reweight the edges if they belong to a shortest path to equal 0 | Find shortest path P from s to t and reverse its edges | Find a new shortest path in the modified graph | Remove any edges visited in both paths and reconnect the paths | Two runs of Dijkstra, linear time to reweight and reverse; total runtime of O(m + log n) | . A* . Want to traverse paths to destination with Dijkstra without going down bad paths | Idea: choose a height function for each vertex v that is easily to calculate and accurately estimates the distance from v to t Must be an underestimate so paths to t eventually go downhill | Can’t decrease too quickly; height between two vertices differs by at most the length of the edge between them | AKA needs to be admissible | . | Reweight the graph by height function Edges will be non-negative because of our height function | Edges with smaller estimates appear shorter | . | Run Dijkstra on this reweighted graph Same runtime as Dijkstra, but with linear time added to reweight | . | .",

Stochastic Processes II (Continuous Processes) . Continuous time processes can be thought of as a probability distribution of the paths a process can take . | Consider a probability space ($ Omega, P$). A stochastic process X can also be thought of as a map from the universe $ Omega$ to the space of real functions defined over $[0, infty]$ . The probability of taking a path in some set A can be computed as $P(X^{-1}(A))$ | P is the probability distribution of the stochastic process | . | . Standard Brownian Motion . Also known as a Weiner process | Standard Brownian motion: There exists a probability distribution over the set of continuous functions $B: R rightarrow R$ satisfying the following conditions: B(0) = 0 | Stationary: For all 0 ≤ s &lt; t, the distribution of B(t) - B(s) follows Normal(0, t - s) | Independent Increment: The random variables $B(t_i) - B(s_i)$ are mutually independent if the intervals $[s_i, t_i]$ are nonoverlapping | . | Can be thought of as the limit of simple random walks where the distance between intervals gets infinitely smaller | Facts: Crosses the x-axis infinitely often | Does not deviate from $x = y^2$ too much | Is nowhere differentiable (with probability 1) Proved using Borel-Cantelli lemma | . | . | . Quadratic Variation . For a partition $ Pi = {t_0, t_1, …, t_j}$ of an interval $[0, T]$, let $ vert Pi vert = text{max}i (t{i+1} - t_i)$. A Brownian motion $B_t$ satisfies the following equation with probability 1: | . lim⁡∣Π∣→0∑i(Bti+1−Bti)2=T lim_{ vert Pi vert to 0} sum_{i} (B_{t_{i+1}} - B_{t_i})^2 = T∣Π∣→0lim​i∑​(Bti+1​​−Bti​​)2=T . Functions that are continuously differentiable follow $ lim_{ vert Pi vert to 0} sum_{i} (f(t_{i+1}) - f(t_i))^2 leq 0$, so Brownian motion varies a lot Can be written as $(dB)^2 = dt$ | . | . Brownian Motion with Drift . Let B(t) be a Brownian motion, and let $ mu$ be a fixed real. The process $X(t) = B(t) + mu t$ is called a Brownian motion with drift $ mu$. $ mu t$ dominates B(t) over time; X(t) will vary around the line $ mu t$ | . | . Ito Calculus .

According to this new model, capital per effective worker doesn’t grow at the steady state, so capital per effective worker also doesn’t grow . K/L increases; K / L = kE, so K/L increases at a rate of g | Y/L increases; Y / L = yE, so Y/L increases at a rate of g | K increases; K = kEL, so K increases at (n + g) | Y increases; Y = yEL, so Y increases at (n + g) | . Thus, standard of living (K/L) growth improves due to improvements in technology. . Implications of the Solow Growth Model . A higher savings rate s implies a higher standard of living | A higher population growth rate n implies a lower standard of living | Assumed that g is the same across countries in steady state | Standard of living grows at rate g in steady state | GDP (Y) grows at g + n in steady state | Countries below k* grow more quickly than those at the steady state | Many of the models grow at the same rate (Y/L and K/L grow at g, for example) | The real wage grows at the same rate as Y/L over time while real return to capital remains constant | . Human Capital . The skills of the labor force also matter for production New production function: Y = F(K, H, L), where H represents human capital | Now two types of capital: physical capital (k = K/EL) and human capital (h = H/EL) | k now depends on two types of saving/investment: investment in physical capital (sk) and investment in human capital (sh) | . | . Convergence . The Solow model predicts that “poor” countries with lower Y/L and K/L should grow more quickly than “rich” ones due to the catch-up effect If this was true, then living standards would converge over time, but there is still a disparity | Studies have disproved unconditional convergence | . | New addendum: The Solow Model predicts conditional convergence which is determined by a country’s own savings and population growth rates Countries therefore have different steady states | . | . Government Policies . According to the Solow Growth Model, the long-run growth rate of output per worker is determined by technology growth rate (g) | The long-run level of output per effective worker is determined by savings rate (s), population growth rate (n), and depreciation rate (delta) Encouraging savings (s) Subsidize savings, reduce budget deficits | . | Encourage investment (sk) Subsidize (or give tax breaks to) investment | . | Encourage education (sh) Subsidize education, give student loans | . | Lower population growth (n) “one child” policy | Education leads to lower population growth, especially for girls | . | Promote technology growth Patent protections, subsidize R&amp;D | . | . | Institutions are also important for economic growth and output/worker Property rights, laws, contract enforcement, risk of government confiscation, competitive markets, (reducing) corruption | . | . Production Function, f . Technology in advanced countries is assumed to be the same, but there can be differences in the production function f Differences in natural resources, climate, geography, urbanization, regulations, financial markets, competitiveness, efficiency, etc. | . | . The Golden Rule . More savings isnt better Higher savings rate s implies higher k and y | If savings rate is too high, then people save all of their income; k and y are maximized but consumption is 0 | . | c = (1-s)f(k) where k is determined by the intersection point of (delta + n + g)k and sf(k) k* is determined by s and vice versa | . | The k* that maximizes consumption is the one where (delta + n + g)k and f(k) have the same slope; in other words, f’(k) = (delta + n + g)k Can calculate s from there | . | . Endogenous Technology Growth . Because so much of growth depends on the growth rate of technology g, there are models that assume g as endogenous | Romer Model models technology as new varieties of capital goods; the more resources devoted to R&amp;D, the higher g gets | No endogenous growth model can be proved empirically | . Growth and the IS-MP-AD-IA Model . Over time, the AD curve shifts to the right because there is more demand (Y, K, C, and I all increase due to population and capital growth) | The IS curve also shifts to the right over time due to passive growth MP curve shifts down to keep interest rates the same over time | . | .",

The Zero Lower Bound and the MP Curve . Because r &gt;= -π, the MP curve is constrained and cannot go below -π, leading to a kink in the curve | Oftentimes, this kink doesn’t matter, but there are situations when the Zero Lower Bound is an issue | There are other things the government can do aside from changing the nominal interest rate in order to improve economic conditions | . Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound . Inflation Expectations . The government can use inflation expectations (ex ante vs. ex post real interest rates) to do monetary policy Firms use the ex ante real interest rate to do business | The government can use monetary policy to make expected inflation greater than actual inflation (i.e. ex ante &lt; ex post) | This means that the MP curve is not as constrained if -π is lower down | . | .

            "content": "Federal Funds Market . Banks hold reserves in cash and at the Fed | Reserves held at the Fed are known as “federal funds” and are like electronic cash Federal funds are very liquid and can be used as payments, to satisfy reserve requirements, etc. | . | Over $2 trillion of interbank payments are made every day | Banks can borrow federal funds from other banks or from the Fed in order to make payments/satisfy reserve requirements These federal funds loans are typically made for one day at a time | . | The central bank is a “banker’s bank”; banks can deposit reserves at and borrow from the central bank | There are three “federal funds” interest rates Interest rate banks receive on reserves (IOR rate) | Interest rate banks pay for loans | Interest rate banks receive pay each other for federal funds loans | . | . Interest on Reserves (IOR) . The IOR/IORB rate (Interest on Reserves (Balances)) is the rate that banks receive from the Fed on federal funds | The IOR rate improves the Fed’s ability to control the R/D ratio, or rr This allows the Fed to better control the money multiplier and total amount of money | . | . Discount Rate (Primary Credit Rate) . The federal funds that the Fed loans out to banks are collateralized so the risk to the Fed is low | These loans are known as “discount window” loans and the interest rate is known as the discount rate or primary credit rate | The discount window is rarely used because it is a sign of weakness to take a loan from the Fed | . Federal Funds Rate . Banks can borrow and lend federal funds to each other via the federal funds market The interest rate on one-day loans between banks for federal loans is known as the federal funds rate | . | The federal funds rate is the one that the Fed targets every day | In theory, the federal funds rate should be between the IOR and primary credit rate, or else banks would have no incentive to give and receive loans from each other | . . If the Fed wants to add reserves to the federal funds market, the Fed buys government bonds from banks Banks trade bonds for cash reserves, or federal funds, increasing the federal funds in circulation | . | If the Fed wants to sell reserves to the federal funds market, the Fed sells government bonds to banks Banks buy bonds for cash reserves, reducing the amount of federal funds in circulation | . | Both processes are accomplished through auction to banks | . How the Fed Controls Interest Rates . There are many other short-term interest rates, such as the treasury bill rate, commercial paper rate, bank deposit rate, etc. | Arbitrage is the act of buying an asset in one market and selling it in another market at a higher price to make a profit If there is a significant profit to be made via arbitrage, then arbitrageurs would being abusing that fact which would drive the prices closer together | . | Arbitrage applies to short-term interest rate markets as well If other short-term interest rates were different, then financial traders at banks would begin arbitraging away the difference | For example: if the federal funds rate was 5.4% and the 1-month Treasury bill interest rate was 5.9%, then banks would borrow federal funds and buy Treasury bills to make a profit | . | Due to arbitrage, all US short-term interest rates move along with the federal funds rate | Arbitrage is harder to do between two different assets, so long-term interest rates can differ from short-term interest rates This means that the 1-month Treasury rate is very close to the federal funds rate, but the 10-year Treasury rate is less linked to the federal funds rate | . | . Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates . The IS-MP curve is in terms of real interest rates, but the cental bank can only control the nominal short-term interest rate In the short-run, we think of inflation as fixed, so the central bank controls the real interest rate by controlling the nominal interest rate | . | . Targeting Interest Rates vs. Targeting Money . The quantity theory of money says the central bank should target the quantity and growth rate of money MV = PY | . | The IS-MP model indicates that the central bank targets the interest rate directly | Because the demand for cash and reserves varies (sometimes by a lot), the velocity of money is not constant, and the money multiplier can shift substantially, it’s difficult to target a monetary base This leads to the Fed targetting a federal funds rate instead due to its stability | Makes it easier to formulate monetary policy, decide on a interest rate level, and communicate monetary policy | All of the world’s major central banks use a short-term interest rate target than a monetary base target | . | .",

Fundamentals of Keynesian Economics . Keynes argues that there is a general economic theory, and classical economics represents one aspect of his theory | Output and employment depends not only on fixed labor supply and capital, but also demand for goods and services Demand is affected by fiscal/monetary policy, demand from foreigners, and other exogenous changes (I, C, etc.) | Output is therefore demand-determined | . | .

Earlier, investment was assumed to be exogenous; now, let’s go back to the assumption that it depends on the interest rate. . PE = MPC * C(Y - T) + I(r) + G . The cominbations of all r and Y that result in a goods market equilibrium is known as the IS curve. . . Note that the IS curve is negatively sloped. Intuitively, this makes sense, as a lower interest rate will increase investment, thus increasing the amount firms plan to spend. To match the increase in expenditure, Y must also increase. . Shifts in the PE curve also shift the IS curve. . MP Curve . The IS curve describes the set of points for which planned expenditure by households and firms equal actual expenditure. In other words, it is a function that describes Y in terms of r, or Y(r). . The MP curve describes how the central bank sets interest rates in response to the economy. In other words, it is a function that describes r in terms of r, or r(Y). . In the IS Curve, we assume that the MP curve is horizontal, but in reality, the central bank sets interest rates in response to the economy as opposed to having it be horizontal. They will lower interest rates if the output is low and increase them if the output is high. . Things that Shift the IS and MP Curves . IS Curve Changes in gov’t spending | Changes in taxes | Changes in consumer confidence (preferences) | Changes in business confidence (preferences) | Changes in an investment subsidy | . | MP Curve Generally, changes to Fed policy will change MP | Changes in inflation | Changes in concerns about future inflation | Changes in the Fed chair | . | .",

The scenario where banks hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves is known as Fractional Reserve Banking, and this automatically expands the amount of money M in the economy. .

Closed economies assume that there is no exports nor imports, but many economies across the world require trade to function | These are open economies, and they are important because many countries and industries rely on international trade | . National Income Accounting . In a closed economy, the equations Y = C + I + G and S = I are true because there is no outside trade G and T represent government spending and taxes | Household disposable income is Y - T | Household consumption and saving is Y - T - C = SH, where C is a function of Y - T s.t.

Is a Current Account (AKA Trade) Deficit Bad? . In some cases, yes; in others, no | If a country has a trade deficit because they have bad domestic products, then the deficit is bad | If a country has a trade deficit because everyone wants to import into the US, then the deficit is good | . Open Economy Model . Three assumptions Domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes | Perfect capital mobilityL no restrictions on international trade in assets | Economy is small: cannot affect the world interest rate | . | Similar to the loanable funds model Production function: Y = F(K, L) | Consumption function: C = C(Y - T) | Investment function: I = I(r) | Exogenous policy variables: G bar, T bar, etc. | . | . Exchange Rates . Nominal exchange rate (e): The relative price of domestic currency in units of foreign currency | Real exchange rate (ε): The relative prive of domestic goods in units of foreign goods Normally equal to 1 (e.g. one JP car is same as one US car) | Can be thought of as the relative price of a basket of goods vs. a basket of foreign goods | . | . ϵ=ePdPf epsilon = e frac{P^d}{P^f}ϵ=ePfPd​ .

Causes of Unemployment . Workers change jobs: career changes, geographic preferences, want new employer, etc. | Firms’ labor needs change: demand for firm’s product changes, technology changes, etc. | As a result, there will always be some unemployment, and this is known as frictional unemployment | Sectoral shifts are changes in composition of demand across industries, such as the increasing demand for computers after technology got better | . Natural Rate of Unemployment .

Unemployment Insurance . Pays part of a worker’s wages for a limited time after losing their job | Increases the natural unemployment rate because it reduces f; workers are less encouraged to find work Big reason why the natural unemployment rate in EU is greater than in the US; high levels of UI | . | Benefits include better job matches, leading to greater productivity in the economy and higher incomes for workers | . Other Government Policies . Government employment agencies: Provide info about job openings to match workers and jobs | . Wage Rigidity . Wages are rigid if they are restricted from adjusting in response to changes in supply and demand Examples include minimum wage laws, union contracts, efficiency wages, etc. | . | In a perfect world with flexible wages, employment will respond perfectly if wage are too high or low | Due to wage rigidity, there will always be some people who are unemployed because wages can’t change | Downward nominal wage rigidity can lead to unemployment when there is a negative demand shock | . Minimum Wage . One source of wage rigidity is minimum wage; the wages for some jobs become too high, so companies don’t create positions for those jobs which leads to unemployment | Minimum wage doesn’t apply to most groups of workers, but it does contribute somewhat to the unemployment rate | Difficult to find solid evidence to connect minimum wage laws to unemployment | Some evidence that teenagers are hurt and low-wage older workers benefit | . Union Contracts . Unions use their labor market power to get higher wages and benefits for their workers | Unions specify wages which leads to wage rigidity | Leads to insiders vs. outsiders problem Union workers, or insiders, want to keep wages high | Unemployed non-union workers, or outsiders, want to get any job but can’t get one because the wages are too high | . | High wages lead to outsiders remaining unemployed | . Efficiency Wages . Firms might pay its workers a higher-than-market wage Reduces turnover and training costs | Increases worker loyalty and effort | Reduces shirking | . | Also causes outsiders to remain unemployed because the firm cannot hire workers at the same wage | .

            "content": "Classical Inflation . Inflation and Money . Inflation: The percentage rate in prices, calculated using measures like CPI | In the short run, doubling the quantity of money in an economy might cause more demand and more output, but in the long run, all the prices would double and everything would remain the same | Inflation must be understood as a monetary phenomenon | Inflation (or increase in price) is related to a change in the money supply | . Money . Money: The stock of assets that can be readily used to make transactions C: Currency (cash and coin); narrowest measure of money supply | M1: C and demand deposits, travelers’ checks, other checkable deposits (i.e. checking accounts) | M2: M1 and small time deposits (i.e. 3 month CD), savings deposits, money market mutual funds, money market deposit accounts | . | Functions of money Medium of Exchange: Used to make purchases | Store of Value: Used to transfer purchasing power to the future | Unit of Account: Used to compare value of goods | . | Commodity money: Money that has intrinsic value, such as gold or silver | Fiat money: Money that is assigned value by a government but has no intrinsic value Paper currency, coins | The transition from commodity to fiat money usually has allowed the conversion of paper money into a commodity; AKA gold standard | . | Good monetary policy does not require commodity-backed policy | . The Quantity Theory of Money . Classical theory of money | Velocity: The rate at which money circulates through an economy; i.e. the number of times a dollar bill is spent V = PY / M, where P is average price per transaction, Y is the volume of transactions, and M is the quantity of money Know nas the quantity equation or the equation of exchange | . | . | The Quantity Theory assumes that velocity is a constant feature of the economy, meaning that people consistently spend money at the same rate | . Since velocity is constant, V=VˉMVˉ=PYIf output is also thought of as constant:MVˉ=PYˉ text{Since velocity is constant, } V = bar{V} M bar{V} = PY text{If output is also thought of as constant:} M bar{V} = P bar{Y}Since velocity is constant, V=VˉMVˉ=PYIf output is also thought of as constant:MVˉ=PYˉ . This equation implies the following: - Money supply determines the nominal GDP (PY) - If the quantity of M changes in the economy, then the nominal GDP must change - In the short run, Y and P will both go up as M increases - In the short run, Y will go back to normal and P would rise in exactly proportion to M - This means that Y is also thought of as fixed . Changes in money will lead to changes in prices; money growth creates price growth, or inflation | . Seigniorage . Fiat money costs very little to produce For example, a $100 bill costs 13 cents to make | . | Seignorage is defined as the money that the government makes from printing money Can be thought of as a tax; increases prices for people, but also increases the amount of money that the government have | . | Because the economy (and output, Y) grows over time, banks must print more money to keep prices steady | Responsible central banks earn seigniorage revenue by slowly increasing the currency, maintaining prices | Some governments rely more on seigniorage which causes higher inflation | . Adjusting Prices for Inflation . p is used to denote prices and pi is used to denote inflation | To adjust a price for inflation, multiply the price by (1 + pi/100)^n where n is the number of years | . Real vs Nominal Interest Rates . Nominal interest rates (denoted by i) do not account for inflation, while real interest rates (denoted by r) do account for it | Fisher equation: (1 + r) = (1 + i) / (1 + pi) | Can use r = i - pi when i and pi are small (&lt;10%) . | Ex ante: Expected real interest rate based on forecasted inflation rate; represented by r^e, using i^e as expected inflation | Ex post: Real interest rate based on inflation rate given data on a past period of time | . Costs and Benefits to Inflation . Classical view: Inflation doesn’t matter because, if it is expected, then prices and wages will be adjusted accordingly “Money is a veil”, simply changing a unit of measure | . | Costs of high inflation Typically unexpected, leads to arbitrary redistributions of wealth | More uncertainty in the economy which makes conducting business more costly | . | Benefits of inflation Reducing nominal wages is difficult due to social norms, so to cut wages, businesses leave nominal wages the same which decreases real wages | Inflation at 2% per year allows the labor market to work well | . | . The Classical Dichotomy . Real variables are measured in quantities of physical units Real GDP, wage, interest rate all measures in quantities of output, not money | . | Nominal variables are measured in money units instead | The Classical Dichotomy separates real and nominal variables, implying that nominal variables do not affect real variables | Monetary Neutrality states that money is irrelevant to understanding real variables; approximately neutral in the long run | .",

Simple steps: . Find MRS | Plug into Expenditures = Income equation | Plug into Endowments equation: xA + xB = x | Production Economies . Characteristics: . Assume individuals are endowed with a set of resources that can be combined to produce goods for consumption | Production precedes trade | Individuals participate in both production and trade | . Autarky . Under autarky, an individual can create a set of bundles underneath their production-possibilities frontier, whose boundary can be written as Q(x, y). . The cost of specializing in the production of x in terms of y can be seen in the slope of the PPF. This is also known as the marginal rate of transformation, and it can be calculated by dividing the marginal cost of x by the marginal cost of y. . Similarly to the problem shown to consumers with budget constraints, the optimal set to produce will be the point of tangency between the PPF and the highest indifference curve. . . . Trade . With trade, the individual will choose the production bundle that maximizes income given prices px and py. . . Additionally, the consumer purchases the bundle that maximizes their utility, which often lies on a higher indifference curve than the autarkic optimum. . . Notice how that the introduction of trade incentives the individual to specialize in the production of a good. . Thus, under trade, there are two separate problems to solve: maximizing income, and maximizing utility. First, find the production bundle that gives the highest budget line and budget constraint. Then, find the highest indifference curve according to that budget constraint. . For consumers, trade allows for a more balanced, preferred bundle, but for the economy, trade allows for specialization which means that there are more goods in the economy. . . Efficiency . Pareto Efficiency . Suppose there are two individuals, A and B, and each individual’s real income is a reasonable measure for their well-being . Social opportunity set: Depicts the entire range of achievable income, IA, IB | Social opportunity frontier: The boundary of the social opportunity set | . There are various ways to gauge efficiency based on the sum of real income, IA + IB . Iso-income line: Combinations of IA and IB which implies a constant sum with a slope of -1 | Maximal income: Where the social opportunity frontier is tangent with the outermost iso-income line | Very similar to budget constraints and isoquant lines | . Pareto efficiency is based off of the observation that, on the frontier, you cannot make one person better off without making the other worse off. . An allocation of goods X is Pareto-preferred to another allocation Y if, under X, everyone is at least as well off as under Y AND at least one individual is better off | Allocation X is Pareto-efficient or Pareto-optimal if no feasible alternative is Pareto-preferred to it All points along the frontier are therefore Pareto-efficient | . | . Characterizing a Pareto-Efficient Outcome . Under perfect competition, utility-maximizing behavior by individuals combined with profit maximizing behavior by firms leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome . An allocation of resources is efficient in production or technically efficient if no further reallocation would permit more of one good to be produced without necessarily reducing the output of some other good. . Pareto-efficiency implies technical efficiency, as not being technically efficient implies that the allocation does not lie on the frontier | Technical efficiency does NOT imply Pareto-efficiency | . Efficient choice of inputs for a single firm: Requires that all inputs held by a firm be fully employed and that the rate of technical substitution between inputs (or the ratio of the inputs’ marginal productivities) be the same across goods produced by the firm. . If one firm has too much labor, then the other will have too much capital. The social planner will then shift some labor and capital to make the ratio of TRS equal. | . Efficient allocation of resources across firms: Requires that the marginal product of any resource in the production of a particular good be the same no matter which firm produces that good. . If the marginal product of capital at firm 1 was greater than the marginal product of labor, then the planner would give firm 1 more capital, and vice versa. | . Efficient choice of output across firms: Requires that the marginal rate of transformation between two products be equalized across firms. . If the marginal rate of transformation for a certain good is higher at firm 1 than firm 2, then the planner will shift production of that good away from firm 2 towards firm 1 | . Efficiency in consumption: Under trade, the MRS are equal between two individuals; in other words, no individual has an incentive to trade any more than they already have. . Efficient balance in consumption and production: Both production and consumption must be efficient. Mathematically, the MRS between two goods should be the same as the corresponding MRT. . The Invisible Hand and the Role of Competitive Prices . The theorem of the invisible hand, or the first theorem of welfare economics, states that no social planner is needed because individuals and firms will naturally reach efficient outcomes. . Profit maximizing production results in technical rates of substitution between inputs being equal, satisfying the clause for an efficient choice of inputs. | The marginal products for each firm will be equal to each other for all firms producing x and y, as a firm not doing so would lose profits on one of the goods, satisfying the clause for efficient allocation of resources. | The marginal cost for firms in a competitive market must be equal to the price it faces. In other words, MCx / MCy = px / py = MRTxy. Thus, this satisfies the clause for efficient choice of output. | Utility maximizing individuals will maximize their utility by default, and at that bundle, they won’t be willing to give up either good to gain more of the other, satisfying efficiency in consumption. . Recall that px / py is the isocost/isoquant line, and profit/utility maximization means that the bundle lies on that line. Thus, the MRT and MRS are both equal to the slope of that line, satisfying the clause of efficient balance in consumption and production. .",

Recall that the average cost of goods is minimized when MC = AC | Must minimize cost before trying to maximize profit | Note that in the long run, there are no fixed costs, so AC = AVC | . Demand Curves and Market Structures .

Competitive Firm Short-Run . In the short run, there are fixed costs, so π=pq−c(q,k′) where k represents the fixed value.The firm will thus choose q such that π=p−cs′=0 and −cs′′≤0 text{In the short run, there are fixed costs, so } pi = pq - c(q, k&amp;#x27;) text{ where k represents the fixed value.} text{The firm will thus choose q such that } pi = p - c_s &amp;#x27; = 0 text{ and } -c_s &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; leq 0In the short run, there are fixed costs, so π=pq−c(q,k′) where k represents the fixed value.The firm will thus choose q such that π=p−cs′​=0 and −cs′′​≤0 .

Short-Run Supply Function of Competitive Market . The quantity supplied by a competitive market is given as the horizontal summation of firms’ supply functions:QS=∑qi text{The quantity supplied by a competitive market is given as the horizontal summation of firms&amp;#x27; supply functions:} Q_S = sum q_iThe quantity supplied by a competitive market is given as the horizontal summation of firms’ supply functions:QS​=∑qi​ . QS is inaccurate because of the input-price effect; the result of all firms expanding output would cause all of their input prices to rise higher. Thus, the industry’s short-run supply curve is less elastic than the individual firms’ supply curves . . Competitive Firm Long-Run . In the long run, there are no fixed costs, so the profit maximizing quantity satisfies the following:π′(q∗)=p−cl′=0π′′(q∗)=−cl′′≤0Additionally, the long-run no-shutdown condition must be satisfied:p≥min{Long-Run Average Cost} text{In the long run, there are no fixed costs, so the profit maximizing quantity satisfies the following:} pi &amp;#x27;(q^*) = p - c_l&amp;#x27; = 0 pi &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27;(q^*) = -c_l&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; leq 0 text{Additionally, the long-run no-shutdown condition must be satisfied:} p geq min { text{Long-Run Average Cost} }In the long run, there are no fixed costs, so the profit maximizing quantity satisfies the following:π′(q∗)=p−cl′​=0π′′(q∗)=−cl′′​≤0Additionally, the long-run no-shutdown condition must be satisfied:p≥min{Long-Run Average Cost} . Industry Supply in the Long Run . You can use horizontal summation on individual firms’ supply curve to find the industry supply curve | Exit-entry effect: In the long-run equilibrium, every firm belonging to the industry must make nonnegative economic profits Positive economic profits cause firms to enter the industry | . | Assumption: The elasticity of supply is greater in the long run than in the short run, as firms can more easily enter/exit from the market | Assumption: In the long run, economic profit for any firm in a competitive equilibrium must equal 0 | . Competitive Long vs. Short Run . If a firm perceives a change to be permanent, then it will make gradual changes; otherwise, it will make more drastic ones to capitalize . . Benefits of Exchange Under Perfect Competition . Because trade is mutually beneficial, the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized under a competitive market. . . The overall surplus can be hindered by government policies, such as taxes or supply quotas. . . . Models of Monopoly . Monopolies are markets with a single supplier | Occurs due to two reasons Technological constraints: The marginal or average costs to produce a good is decreasing over a wide range of output levels relative to the market; in other words, monopolists have extremely low costs of production | Legal constraints: The government might grant certain suppliers the sole right to produce their good | . | . Profit Maximization . Monopolies can choose both the price and the quantity of the good supplied. Their profit maximization problem can be written in one of two ways: . In terms of price: π(P)=P⋅Q(P)−C(Q(P))Q(P)=f(P), or the demand functionP⋅Q(P)=P⋅f(P), or the total revenusC(Q(P))= total costsR=P⋅Q(P)MRP=Q+P⋅∂Q∂PMCP=∂C∂Q⋅∂Q∂P pi (P) = P cdot Q(P) - C(Q(P)) Q(P) = f(P) text{, or the demand function} P cdot Q(P) = P cdot f(P) text{, or the total revenus} C(Q(P)) = text{ total costs} R = P cdot Q(P) MR_P = Q + P cdot frac{ partial Q}{ partial P} MC_P = frac{ partial C}{ partial Q} cdot frac{ partial Q}{ partial P}π(P)=P⋅Q(P)−C(Q(P))Q(P)=f(P), or the demand functionP⋅Q(P)=P⋅f(P), or the total revenusC(Q(P))= total costsR=P⋅Q(P)MRP​=Q+P⋅∂P∂Q​MCP​=∂Q∂C​⋅∂P∂Q​ . Or in terms of demand: π(Q)=P(Q)⋅Q−C(Q)P(Q)=g(Q)=f−1(Q), inverse demandP(Q)⋅Q=g(Q)⋅(Q), total revenuesC(Q)= total costsR=P(Q)⋅QMRQ=P+Q⋅∂P∂QMCQ=∂C∂Q pi (Q) = P(Q) cdot Q - C(Q) P(Q) = g(Q) = f^{-1} (Q) text{, inverse demand} P(Q) cdot Q = g(Q) cdot (Q) text{, total revenues} C(Q) = text{ total costs} R = P(Q) cdot Q MR_Q = P + Q cdot frac{ partial P}{ partial Q} MC_Q = frac{ partial C}{ partial Q}π(Q)=P(Q)⋅Q−C(Q)P(Q)=g(Q)=f−1(Q), inverse demandP(Q)⋅Q=g(Q)⋅(Q), total revenuesC(Q)= total costsR=P(Q)⋅QMRQ​=P+Q⋅∂Q∂P​MCQ​=∂Q∂C​ . To find the profit maximizing quantity/price, we must set the marginal revenue and cost equal to each other; that is, the first-order condition: . π=MR−MC=0Price:π′=Q+P⋅∂Q∂P−∂C∂Q⋅∂Q∂PQuantity:π′=P+Q⋅∂P∂Q−∂C∂Q pi = MR - MC = 0 text{Price:} pi &amp;#x27; = Q + P cdot frac{ partial Q}{ partial P} - frac{ partial C}{ partial Q} cdot frac{ partial Q}{ partial P} text{Quantity:} pi &amp;#x27; = P + Q cdot frac{ partial P}{ partial Q} - frac{ partial C}{ partial Q}π=MR−MC=0Price:π′=Q+P⋅∂P∂Q​−∂Q∂C​⋅∂P∂Q​Quantity:π′=P+Q⋅∂Q∂P​−∂Q∂C​ . Another condition that must be satistfied is the second-order condition: . π=∂MR∂Q−∂MC∂Q≤0Quantity:π′′(Q∗)=2∂P∂Q+∂2P∂Q2−∂2C∂Q2 pi = frac{ partial MR}{ partial Q} - frac{ partial MC}{ partial Q} leq 0 text{Quantity:} pi &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; (Q^*) = 2 frac{ partial P}{ partial Q} + frac{ partial ^2 P}{ partial Q^2} - frac{ partial ^2 C}{ partial Q^2}π=∂Q∂MR​−∂Q∂MC​≤0Quantity:π′′(Q∗)=2∂Q∂P​+∂Q2∂2P​−∂Q2∂2C​ . However, monopolies can markup their price higher over their cost. Thus, we can use elasticity to find the optimal price/quantity: . eQP=∂QP∂PQ&lt;0MR=P+Q⋅∂P∂Q=P[1+QP∂P∂Q]=P[1−1∣eQP∣]e_{QP} = frac{ partial QP}{ partial PQ} &lt; 0 MR = P + Q cdot frac{ partial P}{ partial Q} = P [1 + frac{Q}{P} frac{ partial P}{ partial Q}] = P [1 - frac{1}{|e_{QP}|}]eQP​=∂PQ∂QP​&lt;0MR=P+Q⋅∂Q∂P​=P[1+PQ​∂Q∂P​]=P[1−∣eQP​∣1​] . There are three cases of elasticity: . Demand is infinitely elastic (like it is in perfect competition). Then, MR = P &gt; 0 | Demand is relatveily inelastic (i.e. it is between negative infinity and -1). Then, MR &gt; 0, but MR &lt; P | Demand is relatively elastic (i.e. it is between -1 and 0). Then, MR &lt;= 0 | . We can apply elasticity to marginal cost as well. . MC=P[1−1∣eQP∣]P−MCP=1∣eQP∣P=MC÷[1−1∣eQP∣]MC = P[1 - frac{1}{|e_{QP}|}] frac{P - MC}{P} = frac{1}{|e_{QP}|} P = MC div [1 - frac{1}{|e_{QP}|}]MC=P[1−∣eQP​∣1​]PP−MC​=∣eQP​∣1​P=MC÷[1−∣eQP​∣1​] . Comparison with Perfect Competition . Comparing First-Order Conditions . One big difference between competitive and monopolistic firms are their marginal revenue functions. . Competitive: MR=PMonopoly: MR=P+Q⋅∂P∂Q text{Competitive: } MR = P text{Monopoly: } MR = P + Q cdot frac{ partial P}{ partial Q}Competitive: MR=PMonopoly: MR=P+Q⋅∂Q∂P​ . This is because competitive firms are price takers and do not influence the price of their good. . Comparing Outcomes . The overall surplus in a monopolistic industry is lower than in competitive industries, as firms will abuse their leverage and take away from consumers. . . Price Discrimination . Price Discrimination: The practice of selling identical units of output at different prices | Multiple ways of performing price discrimination | . Market Segmentation . Monopolists divide customers into two or more groups, charging each group a different price | Requirements Monopolists must be able to separate buyers and enforce pricing policies | Leakage must be prevented; people from a cheaper market cannot sell to a more expensive market | . | Also known as third-degree price discrimination | . Suppose the firm identifies n separate markets. The firm’s profits are:π=∑i=1nPi(Qi)⋅Qi−C(∑inQi)The first order condition is:∂π(Qi)∂Qi=Pi+Qi∂Pi∂Qi−∂C∂Qi=0Note that MRi=Pi+Qi∂Pi∂Qi and ∂C∂Qi is equal for all i.Thus, the following equation holds: MRi=MRj for all i, j where i≠jFor each market i,MRi=Pi+Qi∂Pi∂Qi=Pi[1+QiPi∂Pi∂Qi]=Pi[1−1∣ei∣]Thus, Pi[1−1∣ei∣]=Pj[1−1∣ej∣]Therfore, if Pi&gt;Pj, then1−1∣ei∣&lt;1−1∣ej∣→1∣ej∣&lt;1∣ei∣  ⟺  ∣ei∣&lt;∣ej∣ text{Suppose the firm identifies n separate markets.

This math shows that the market segment with the more elastic demand will be charged a lower price, and vice versa. . Multi-Part Pricing . Defined as charging a different price for different quantities of output purchased by a single consumer | Also known as second-degree price discrimination | Allows firms to gain more profit by increasing the number of consumers | . . Perfect Price Discrimination . A different price can be charged to each customer for each unit of output purchased | Also known as first-degree price discrimination | Impossible in practice due to lack of information, but makes it so that there is no deadweight loss | . . Regulation of Natural Monopolies . Monopolies are regulated to get rid of deadweight loss; marginal costs equaling marginal revenue is the most efficient way to have a market | In practice, regulation aims to limit monopolies to accruing 0 economic profit | Regulations depend on the nature of the monopoly, or the source of its power Natural monopolies are monopolies which can produce any output at a lower cost than its competitors | . | Average Cost regulation forces monopolies to charge at their average cost which causes the firm to have zero economic profit Note that this regulation does not deincentivize innovation; in practice, the government cannot keep the regulated price at the firm’s average cost, so if the firm innovates and decreases their average cost, they enjoy higher profits for a time | To prevent other firm’s from entering the market, the monopolizing firm must keep their prices at or below their average cost; that is, P &lt;= AC | . | . Models of Oligopoly . Basic Models . Oligopolies are defined as markets with a few firms that are all not price takers Assume that all firms in the oligopoly are identical.The quantity produced by a firm i in the oligopoly is denoted by qi for i∈[1,n]Q=∑i=1nqiP=P(Q)=P(∑i=1nqi)Each firm maximizes its own profits subject to the market and technological constraints: πi=P(Q)qi−C(qi) text{Assume that all firms in the oligopoly are identical.} text{The quantity produced by a firm i in the oligopoly is denoted by } q_i text{ for } i in [1, n] Q = sum _{i = 1}^{n} q_i P = P(Q) = P( sum _{i = 1}^{n} q_i) text{Each firm maximizes its own profits subject to the market and technological constraints: } pi _i = P(Q) q_i - C(q_i)Assume that all firms in the oligopoly are identical.The quantity produced by a firm i in the oligopoly is denoted by qi​ for i∈[1,n]Q=∑i=1n​qi​P=P(Q)=P(∑i=1n​qi​)Each firm maximizes its own profits subject to the market and technological constraints: πi​=P(Q)qi​−C(qi​) | . Quasi-Competitive Model . If all firms are price-taking: . πi=Pqi−C(qi)FOC: ∂πi∂qi=P−∂C(qi)∂qi=0 pi _i = P q_i - C(q_i) text{FOC: } frac{ partial pi _i}{ partial q_i} = P - frac{ partial C(q_i)}{ partial q_i} = 0 πi​=Pqi​−C(qi​)FOC: ∂qi​∂πi​​=P−∂qi​∂C(qi​)​=0 . This is identical to the perfectly competitive model. . Cartel Model . If all firms coordinate their decisions to behave as a single monopoly, they can choose their outputs as follows to maximize joint profits: . Π≡∑i=1nπi=P(Q)Q−∑i=1nC(qi)FOC: ∂Π∂qi=P(Q)∂Q∂qi+∂P(Q)∂Q∂Q∂qiQ−∂C(qi)∂qi=0 Pi equiv sum _{i = 1}^{n} pi _i = P(Q) Q - sum _{i = 1}{n} C(q_i) text{FOC: } frac{ partial Pi}{ partial q_i} = P(Q) frac{ partial Q}{ partial q_i} + frac{ partial P(Q)}{ partial Q} frac{ partial Q}{ partial q_i} Q - frac{ partial C(q_i)}{ partial q_i} = 0Π≡i=1∑n​πi​=P(Q)Q−i=1∑​nC(qi​)FOC: ∂qi​∂Π​=P(Q)∂qi​∂Q​+∂Q∂P(Q)​∂qi​∂Q​Q−∂qi​∂C(qi​)​=0 . This is identical to the single monopoly model. However, this is not feasible. . Firms cannot collude due to anti-trust acts | Too much information required; market demand, individual firm marginal costs, etc. | Unstable solution; each firm has an incentive to increase their quantity to increase their profits | . Cournot Solution . Assume that all firms realize that they influence the price and that there is no collusion. . πi=P(Q)qi−C(qi)FOC: ∂πi∂qi=P(Q)+∂P(Q)∂Q∂Q∂qiqi−∂C(qi)∂qi=0SOC: π′′≤0 pi _i = P(Q) q_i - C(q_i) text{FOC: } frac{ partial pi _i}{ partial q_i} = P(Q) + frac{ partial P(Q)}{ partial Q} frac{ partial Q}{ partial q_i} q_i - frac{ partial C(q_i)}{ partial q_i} = 0 text{SOC: } pi &amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; leq 0πi​=P(Q)qi​−C(qi​)FOC: ∂qi​∂πi​​=P(Q)+∂Q∂P(Q)​∂qi​∂Q​qi​−∂qi​∂C(qi​)​=0SOC: π′′≤0 . This solution lies between the cartel and perfect competition solutions. . The Cournot solution will output more than the cartel solution, as each firm in the oligopoly will perceive an increase in their quantity to affect the price less compared to a monopoly i.e. if one firm increases output by 1, they have less influence than if the monopoly increases output by 1 | . | The Cournot solution will output less than the competitive solution, as each firm acknowledges that they influence the price by increasing output | . . Game Theory . The Oligopoly market structure can be thought of as a game. Games are characterized by the following: . Players: Each decision maker is called a player, indexed by i = A, B, …, N where N is the number of players. | Actions: Each player can choose an action si from a set of moves Si | Strategies: A strategy specifies an action which might be contingent on some condition X. The action based on a strategy can be thought of as a function si(X) | Payoffs: Each possible outcome of a game creates a reward for the players. Realized payoff will be determined by strategies adopted by the players and perhaps some factors outside of the control of the players (“nature”). This can be expressed as a monetary reward or in utility. | . In a two player game where i=A,BUA(sA,sB) is the payoff obtained by player A when player A and B choose strategiessA and sB, respectively.UB(sA,sB) is the payoff obtained by player B when player A and B choose strategiessA and sB, respectively. text{In a two player game where } i = A, B U_A (s_A, s_B) text{ is the payoff obtained by player A when player A and B choose strategies} s_A text{ and } s_B text{, respectively.} U_B (s_A, s_B) text{ is the payoff obtained by player B when player A and B choose strategies} s_A text{ and } s_B text{, respectively.} In a two player game where i=A,BUA​(sA​,sB​) is the payoff obtained by player A when player A and B choose strategiessA​ and sB​, respectively.UB​(sA​,sB​) is the payoff obtained by player B when player A and B choose strategiessA​ and sB​, respectively. . In Normal form representation, games are represented as a payoff matrix. . . Games can have various rules. . Cooperative or non-cooperative; i.e., cartel vs. competition | One-shot or repeated; i.e., how many times is the game played? | Simultaneous of sequential moves; i.e., do players act at the same time? | Complete or incomplete information; i.e., how much do players know about each other? | . Games in this class will be non-cooperative, one-shot, simultaneous, and with complete information. . Nash Equilibrium in static games . Consider a two player game where i = A, B. The equilibrium of the game is defined in terms of the players’ best responses. . A pair of strategies (s&lt;/sup&gt;A, s*B) represents a Nash equilibrium if s*A is A’s best strategy when B plays s*B and vice versa. These strategies are also known as *dominant strategies. . The classic example of Nash Equilibrium is the Prisoners’ Dilemma, where both players have a dominant strategy and as such there is one equilibrium. However, there are cases where there are more than one equilibria, and those cases occur when there are many, continuous strategies. . Examples of Games and Equilibria . . . . Equilibrium Refinements . There are some ways to rule out equilibria when multiple exist. . A strategy is strictly dominant if the payoff received is greater than any other strategy regardless of what the other player does | A strategy is weakly dominant if the payoff received is greater than or equal to any other strategy regardless of what the other player does AND it is greater than at least one other strategy | A dominant strategy equilibrium is a choice of strategies where each player has a strategy that (weakly) dominates all other strategies | . To figure out the Nash equilibria, we can remove any strategies that are dominated. For example, in the Prisoners’ Dilemma, though both parties cooperating result in the best outcome, cooperation is dominated by betrayal. . Dynamic Games . Dynamic games are games with a temporal element (such as being sequential, repeated, etc.) . . We can turn this game into a sequential game. . . In this sequential game, A realizes that choosing N will always result in them receiving 2. Thus, A will choose L in order to receive 3 payoff, while B chooses N. The equilibrium is therefore (L, N). . A sub-game perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium which is not only an overall equilibrium but an equilibrium in each sub-game. To find this equilibrium, induction must be performed on each sub-game. For instance, in a sequential game, the player with the second-to-last move can look at what the player with the last move will choose. . Imperfect Competition in Static Games . Static games are games that are non-cooperative, one-shot games with complete information and simultaneous moves. . Bertrand-Nash Equilibrium . Consider a duopoly with firms A and B. Each produces the same good at a constant marginal cost c. A chooses a price PA and B chooses PB. Both firms make their choice such that Pi &gt;= c, where P = P(Q) and Q = qA + qB. . Since the goods are identical, the firm that offers the good at a lower price will capture the entire market. Assume that if PA = PB, each firm takes half. Note that, because both firms don’t want to lose the market, they will both charge a price where Pi = c, leading to both firms making no profit. . In the competitive solution, A and B choose the same price, where PA = PB = c. . Neither firm can choose a price higher than their marginal cost, as the other firm will choose a lower price and capture the entire market | Both firms must choose a price equal to their marginal cost, resulting in the equilibrium | The profit will be equal to 0 because price is equal to marginal cost | . Note that in situations where one firm captures the whole market does NOT mean that the firm has a monopoly. This is because the optimal pricing for the monopoly would allow the opposing firm to reenter the market, thus reducing market power. . Cournot-Nash Equilibrium . Suppose that there are capacity constraints qiˉ and let Pˉ represent the price that would prevail when production by the firms is at capacity, Pˉ=P(∑iqiˉ) text{Suppose that there are capacity constraints } bar{q_i} text{ and let } bar{P} text{ represent the price that would prevail when production by the firms is at capacity, } bar{P} = P ( sum _i bar{q_i})Suppose that there are capacity constraints qi​ˉ​ and let Pˉ represent the price that would prevail when production by the firms is at capacity, Pˉ=P(i∑​qi​ˉ​) . Let there be two firms A and B who both produce at the same marginal cost c. . There are two stages to this game: .

Repeated Static Games and Tacit Collusion . Repeated static games, which are defined as dynamic, non-cooperative, simultaneous move games with complete information, have wide strategy sets due to the sheer amount of moves that either firm can choose. Firms can announce their future moves that are based on the present state which can lead to collusion. . The question is: Does collusion occur in repeated static games? . One-Shot Game . In a duopoly, firms have four options, based on (C)olluding and (D)efecting. . (C, C): Both firms choose the monopoly price and maximize profits | (D, D): Both firms attempt to undercut each other by setting price equal to marginal cost, leading to the competitive solution | (D, C) and (C, D): One firm undercuts the monopoly price while the other doesn’t, so the defecting firm gets the entirety of the market share and the most profit possible | . In this scenario, the Nash equilibrium is (D, D). . Finite Repetition . Suppose the game is played T times. The choice of defecting or colluding can be thought of as a trigger strategy. . A simple trigger strategy would be: defect if the other firm defected last round; otherwise, collude. | . However, in finite repetition, the repeated game degenerates to a one-shot game. Think about the scenario in which both firms colluded for all T - 1 games. Both firms are thus incentivized to defect on the last game, as they can get a temporary gain of half of the monopoly’s profit and because there is no future to worry about. However, because this last game is fixed, the decision to defect recurses for the remaining subgames, all the way from T - 1, T - 2, …, 1. . Infinite Repetition . Assume that both firms take the same trigger strategy detailed in the finite games. Note that, if both firms collude initially, then they will collude infinitely, but if they don’t collude, then they will defect infinitely. Suppose further that both firms have a discount factor that determines how likely they are to repeat the results of a given sub-game. Thus, the expected profits can as the following: . . . There exist a few theorems regarding this result: . Severity of the Punishment: A shorter punihsment might support collusion. Different punishment lengths lead to many equilibria | Power of the Shadow of the Future: If firms are sufficiently patient or believe that the game will last sufficiently long, then collusion will be further supported in the finite game | . Strategic Considerations with Entry and Exit . One-time expenditures necessary to enter a market are known as sunk costs. This can be expressed in a cost function: . ct=c(qt)=S+Ft+a⋅qtWhere S is a per-period amortization of sunk costs, F1 denotes the fixed cost in period t,and qt is the quantity produced in period t.c_t = c(q_t) = S + F_t + a cdot q_t text{Where S is a per-period amortization of sunk costs, } F_1 text{ denotes the fixed cost in period t,} text{and } q_t text{ is the quantity produced in period t.}ct​=c(qt​)=S+Ft​+a⋅qt​Where S is a per-period amortization of sunk costs, F1​ denotes the fixed cost in period t,and qt​ is the quantity produced in period t. . Are sunk costs good or bad? . First-move Advantage . Suppose that firm A leads, and B follows. Firm A has a variety of options, and it knows that whatever price/quantity it chooses could influence B’s decision to enter the market. . . .",

A firm is a cost minimizer if it produces any given output level (y &gt; 0) with the smallest possible total cost | Note that factor and input are synonyms in this chapter; they are interchangable | .

Note that the total cost function does not include the amounts of inputs; this is because the total cost function is implied to use the optimal amount of inputs to minimize costs In other words, the total cost function gives the firm’s smallest possible total cost for producing y units of output given input prices w = (w1, …, wn) | . | . Cost Minimization Problem . Given two inputs and one output, we get the production function y = f(x1, x2) | Given the input prices w1, w2, the cost of an input bundle (x1, x2) is w1x1 + w2x2 | .

The levels x1*(w1, w2, y) and x2*(w1, w2, y) in the least costly input bundle are the firm’s conditional demands for inputs 1 and 2. .

The graph of isocost lines is therefore a series of parallel lines, with lower costs being closer to the origin | . .

In the short-run, firms have one or more fixed costs; in the long-run, all costs are variable | Assuming that a firm uses two inputs (with the amount of one of the inputs being fixed), we can write the profit function as follows: π=pf(x1,x2ˉ)−w1x1−w2x2ˉwhere p is output price, w is input price, and f is the production function pi = pf(x_1, bar{x_2}) - w_1 x_1 - w_2 bar{x_2} text{where p is output price, w is input price, and f is the production function}π=pf(x1​,x2​ˉ​)−w1​x1​−w2​x2​ˉ​where p is output price, w is input price, and f is the production function | Maximizing this function means that we must find the local maximum of π with respect to x1 | . The first derivative of the profit is given as:π′=p∂f(x1∗,x2ˉ)∂x1−w1The maximizing quantity of x1 is found when the first derivative is 0 and the second derivative is negative:p∂f(x1∗,x2ˉ)∂x1−w1=0This can be simplified to pMP1=w1 which will give the maximizing quantity of x1 text{The first derivative of the profit is given as:} pi&amp;#x27; = frac{p partial f(x_1^*, bar{x_2})}{ partial x_1} - w_1 . text{The maximizing quantity of } x_1 text{ is found when the first derivative is 0 and the second derivative is negative:} frac{p partial f(x_1^*, bar{x_2})}{ partial x_1} - w_1 = 0 . text{This can be simplified to } p MP_1 = w_1 text{ which will give the maximizing quantity of } x_1&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The first derivative of the profit is given as:π′=∂x1​p∂f(x1∗​,x2​ˉ​)​−w1​The maximizing quantity of x1​ is found when the first derivative is 0 and the second derivative is negative:∂x1​p∂f(x1∗​,x2​ˉ​)​−w1​=0This can be simplified to pMP1​=w1​ which will give the maximizing quantity of x1​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Using the equation for profit: π=pf(x1,x2ˉ)−w1x1−w2x2ˉ=py−w1x1−w2x2ˉThe equation of a short-run isoprofit line is: y=w1px1+π+w2x2ˉp text{Using the equation for profit: } pi = pf(x_1, bar{x_2}) - w_1 x_1 - w_2 bar{x_2} = py - w_1 x_1 - w_2 bar{x_2} text{The equation of a short-run isoprofit line is: } y = frac{w_1}{p} x_1 + frac{ pi + w_2 bar{x_2}}{p}Using the equation for profit: π=pf(x1​,x2​ˉ​)−w1​x1​−w2​x2​ˉ​=py−w1​x1​−w2​x2​ˉ​The equation of a short-run isoprofit line is: y=pw1​​x1​+pπ+w2​x2​ˉ​​ . The isoprofit line is useful in order to find the profit-maximizing plan, as the best plan will lie on the highest isoprofit line | . Comparative Static Analysis of Profit Maximization . Keeping x2 fixed: If the price of the output (y) goes up, then the optimal amounts of y and x1 go up as well | If the price of input 1 goes up, then the slope of the isoprofit line goes up, meaning that the optimal amounts of y and x1 go down | | If the price of input 2 goes up, then the optimal amounts of either inputs are unchanged; the only thing that changes is the y-intercept of the isoprofit line, meaning that the firm simply makes less profit | . | . Long-Run Profit Maximization . Using the same logic as the short-run, we can find the optimal amount of inputs for any amount of variable inputs | . Recall that the optimal amount of input 1 in the short-run is given by pMP1=w1.When there are multiple variable costs, this equation MUST hold. text{Recall that the optimal amount of input 1 in the short-run is given by } p MP_1 = w_1 text{.} text{When there are multiple variable costs, this equation MUST hold.}Recall that the optimal amount of input 1 in the short-run is given by pMP1​=w1​.When there are multiple variable costs, this equation MUST hold. .

Returns-to-Scale . If a competitive firm’s techonology exhibits decreasing RTS, then there is only one “highest” isoprofit line, meaning that there is one, unique production plan | If a competitive firm’s technology exhibits increasing RTS, then there are infinitely many highest isoprofit lines, meaning that the firm does NOT have a profit-maximizing plan A technology can have increasing RTS in the short-run, but if it is infinitely increasing RTS, then firms would keep getting infinitely bigger, breaking the assumption that the firm is competitive | . | If a competitive firm’s technology exhibits constant RTS, then the production function is linear, meaning that the isoprofit line MUST coincide with the production function The profit of this isoprofit line has to be 0, as doubling the inputs should lead to a double in your outputs (2 x 0 = 0) | If the profit of the isoprofit lines was not 0, then you could continue to make more and more profit infinitely, leading to the same conclusion as increasing RTS | If the slope of the isoprofit line does NOT coincide with the production function, then you can keep taking higher and higher isoprofit lines; thus, they must coincide | . | . Revealed Profitability . Suppose that production bundle (x’, y’) is chosen at (w’, p’). (x’, y’) must therefore be profit-maximizing at (w’, p’). . Assuming that nothing is known about the production function, all we can do is draw one isoprofit line intersecting (x’, y’) | The more known points, the more isoprofit lines drawn, and the more is revealed about the technology set | . Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization (AKA WAPM) . Suppose that a production bundle (x’, y’) is chosen at prices (w’, p’) and bundle (x’’, y’’) is chosen at prices (w’’, p’’) This means that p’y’ - w’x’ MUST be greater than p’y’’ - w’x’’, as (x’, y’) is the profit maximizing bundle at (w’, p’) | . | This observation gives the Weak Axiom of Profit Maximization | .

One use case for corner bundles is when goods are perfect substitutes, as a consumer would spend their entire budget on the cheaper good and buy none of the more expensive one. Recall that the graph of the ICs for perfect substitutes looks like this (slopes of -1): . . If the price of one good is cheaper than another, then the BC would intersect both the highest IC (when purchasing all of cheaper good) and lowest IC (when purchasing all of expensive good). This is because the slope of the BC (-p1/p2) is not -1 if the prices differ. When the prices are the same, any bundle on the budget constraint will do, as all the bundles on the BC belong to the same IC. . . Perfect Complements . Recall that if two goods are perfect complements, then the utility function takes the form u(x1,x2)=min(ax1,x2) text{Recall that if two goods are perfect complements, then the utility function takes the form } u(x_1, x_2) = min(ax_1, x_2) Recall that if two goods are perfect complements, then the utility function takes the form u(x1​,x2​)=min(ax1​,x2​) . In this case, there are no corner solutions, and you can draw a line through the kinks. The intersection of the line through the kinks with the budget constraint thus gives the most preferred affordable bundle. . . ax1=x2 represents the line of &quot;perfect consumption&quot;; that is, no units of good 1 or 2 are wasted.To find the most preferred affordable bundle, the bundle should lie on ax1=x2 and on the BC.Equation A: ax1=x2Equation B: p1x1+p2x2=mPlug Equation A in to B:p1x1+p2(ax1)=mx1(p1+ap2)=mx1=mp1+ap2x2=amp1+ap2ax_1 = x_2 text{ represents the line of &quot;perfect consumption&quot;; that is, no units of good 1 or 2 are wasted.} text{To find the most preferred affordable bundle, the bundle should lie on } ax_1 = x_2 text{ and on the BC.} text{Equation A: } ax_1 = x_2 text{Equation B: } p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m text{Plug Equation A in to B:} p_1 x_1 + p_2 (ax_1) = m x_1 (p_1 + ap_2) = m x_1 = frac{m}{p_1 + ap_2} x_2 = frac{am}{p_1 + ap_2}ax1​=x2​ represents the line of &quot;perfect consumption&quot;; that is, no units of good 1 or 2 are wasted.To find the most preferred affordable bundle, the bundle should lie on ax1​=x2​ and on the BC.Equation A: ax1​=x2​Equation B: p1​x1​+p2​x2​=mPlug Equation A in to B:p1​x1​+p2​(ax1​)=mx1​(p1​+ap2​)=mx1​=p1​+ap2​m​x2​=p1​+ap2​am​ .",

Completeness: The set of preference relations is complete; that is, for any two bundles x and y, it is always possible to make the statement that x is weakly preferred to y, y is weakly preferred to x, or both | Reflexivity: Preferences need to be reflexive; that is, any bundle x is at least as good as itself, or x is weakly preferred to x for all x | Transitivity: Preferences need to be transitive; that is, if x is weakly preferred to y, and y is weakly preferred to z, then x is weakly preferred to z | Preference relations can be though of as a directed graph, where each node is a bundle and each directed edge represents weak preference | . Indifference Curve . In order to graph bundles on two dimensions as opposed to three (utility, x, and y), indifference curves are implemented | .

It includes the indifference curve.}WP(x) represents the set of bundles that are weakly preferred to X. It includes the indifference curve. . Because we assume that consumers are rational, any sets that are strictly preferred to x must not be affordable, as they would purchase the bundles that make them better off | . SP(x) represents the set of bundles that are strictly preferred to X. It DOES NOT include the indifference curve. text{SP(x) represents the set of bundles that are strictly preferred to X. It DOES NOT include the indifference curve.}SP(x) represents the set of bundles that are strictly preferred to X. It DOES NOT include the indifference curve. . By definition, indifference curves cannot intersect, as having a “shared bundle” would mean that all of the bundles in both curves are equally preferred to that bundle and thus each other, making them the same curve | . Slopes of Indifference Curves . When more of a commodity is always preferred, the commodity is a good If every commodity is a good, then the ICs are negatively sloped | Intuitively, this makes sense; going up/right would give you better bundles (not the same) and going left/down would give you worse bundles (not the same). Thus, indifference curves must be negatively sloped downwards and to the right so bundles have the same preference | . | When less of a commodity is always preferred, the commodity is a bad If every commodity is a bad, then the ICs are still negatively sloped by the same logic for if every commodity was a good | If one commodity is a bad and the other is a good, then the ICs will be positively sloped Going up/left would make you better off while going right/down would make you worse off, so the IC must go up and to the right | . | . | . Perfect Substitutes . If a consumer regards units of commodities 1 and 2 as equivalent, then the commodities are perfect substitutes Because the commodities can be swapped out, the total amount of the two commodities determines the rank order of the bundles, meaning that only one value represents each indifference curve and that said curve can be graphed in one dimension | . | Graphing the ICs of perfect substitutes in two dimensions will reveal that all of their slopes are constantly -1, making them all parallel | . . Perfect Complements . If a consumer always consumes units of commodities 1 and 2 in fixed proportion (such as 1 to 1), then the commodities are perfect complements Because the commodities are always consumed in the same proportion, the number of pairs/combos that you can make in said proportion determines the ranked order of the bundles (AKA determined by the “limiting reactant”) | For example, if two goods are consumed in a one-to-one ratio, then the bundles (5, 5), (5, 9), and (6, 5) would all be ranked equally | . | Graphing the ICs of perfect complements in two dimensions will create L-shaped curves | . .",

Building from last time, suppose that you can now trade a food stamp for 50 cents Assume that food stamps can only be sold, not purchased, by households | The budget constraint increases at the top while the majority of the budget constraint remains the same This is because a household would never sell food stamps most of the time; you lose 50 cents of value, and if you cut back on spending, you would cut back on dollar spending, not food stamp spending | . | | . | . Relative Prices . Numeraire: Unit of account Changing the numeraire does not change neither the budget constraint nor the budget set, as all relative prices remain the same | Interestingly, we can use the price of a good as a numeraire For example, good 1 would be worth 1 unit of good 1, and good 2 + consumer income would be evaluated similarly | . | . | . Shape of Budget Constraints . A linear budget constraint means that the exchange rate (or opportunity cost) remains constant, but oftentimes, that is not the case Consider the food stamps example; the graph of the budget constraint had changing slopes because the exchange rate varied | In general, if prices are constant, the budget constraint will be a straight line (AKA a budget line) | . | Quantitative discounts and quantity penalties will often affect the price of a good depending on how much ones buys “Buying in bulk” is an example of a quantitative discount, while government restrictions on buying too much of a good would be an example of a quantity penalty | Assuming that one good’s price (on y axis) is constant and the other’s price (on x axis) fluctuates: A quantitative penalty would cause the graph to be concave dow; i.e. the more you buy, the worse the relative price gets (represented in black) | A quantitative discount would cause the graph to be concave up; i.e. the more you buy, the better the relative price gets (represented in red) | | . | . | .

Determinants as Volume/Areas . A 2x2 matrix has two columns; representing the columns as vectors gives us a parallelogram in two dimensions. The area of this parallelogram is equal to the absolute value of the matrix’s determinant. . For example, a parallelogram represented by vectors (-2, 3) and (3, 0) will have an area equal to the determinant of the matrix . (−2330)→abs(−9)=9 begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; 3 3 &amp; 0 end{pmatrix} rightarrow abs(-9) = 9(−23​30​)→abs(−9)=9 . For a parallelopiped represented by the vectors u, v, and w, the volume will be equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix containing columns u, v, and w. . If we take an area R and transform it using linear transformation T into R’, then Area(R’) = | det(AT) | * Area(R). | . Example .

And the cultural taboo against emotional expression? | . | . | Charles’ Mother Decides to live in an hour time loop, but also blames Charles for putting her in there Concept of free will vs. determinism | Important to note that the loop replays a dinner scene with Charles and his father, shows her nostalgia for old times with her husband and son | . | Charles’ mother’s decision to choose a loop where she cooks dinner further cements herself as a woman who can only connect with her family through domestic labor; represents the idea of the trailing partner who only immigrates because of their partner Trailing partners are deprofessionalized and are unable to do work in their new countries, leading to feelings of alienation | Trailing partners can only do gendered work | Secondariness and deprofessionalism are two recurring themes in Asian-American fiction | . | In the scene outside of time where Charles sees his mom as The Woman My Mother Should Have Been, The Woman My Mother Should Have Been represents his mother as the best version that she could be Charles runs away because he realizes that she was completely independent of the father-son axis, that she had her own aspirations and dreams but was forced to live as a domestic laborer | . | . | Genre and Metafiction as Solutions In Yu’s description of Universe 31, he creates a metaphor for the Asian-American immigration experience inside of the universe of the book Uses science fiction to describe the universe which is indicative of the concept of the Two Cultures | Easier to use science fiction because it is more sanitized, less emotional, more objective | . | For immigrants, there are various genres that are related to their stereotypes; two cultures, generational convergence, STEM careers | Metafiction is defined as a genre that is self-referential about its existence as fiction and breaks the fourth wall The use of science fictional “guides” between chapters is metafictional and is used to further describe the Asian-Americans and their experience | . | Yu’s use of genre ambiguity (horror, science fiction, realistic fiction, etc.) is class ambiguity | . | If your path is carved out by your family, then you HAVE to know “How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe” Two cultures, STEM focus, have to be able to learn to work around your parents and handle your expectations | Asian-Americans not doing STEM don’t lose their parents; their parents feel like they lose their children, as they are no longer able to connect with and understand them | . | Ultimately, the story is about Charles’ father and his attempts to return back to a time before his A and B story split, as he believes that his immigration caused this split | .",

All are used to solve systems of linear equations, and importantly, all operations are reversible. . Pivots . In reducing a matrix that represents a system, our goal is to have as many pivots as possible and get the matrix down to row echelon form. A matrix in row echelon form looks like the following: . (12100−32−200−88) left( begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 0 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 &amp; -2 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -8 &amp; 8 end{array} right) ⎝ . ⎛​100​2−30​12−8​0−28​⎠ . ⎞​ . As shown above, row echoleon forms have a pivot in every row. A pivot is a value where either everything before (left of) it is a zero and everything below it is a zero (so 1, -3, and -8). It is also effective to reduce down the matrix to a form such as this: . (100x010y001z) left( begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; x 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; y 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; z end{array} right) ⎝ . ⎛​100​010​001​xyz​⎠ . ⎞​ . This is reduced row echelon form and is easy to reach when you have the row echelon form. . If the row echelon form has zeroes at the bottom but a nonzero constant such as this: . (014−5135−2000−10) left( begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; -5 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; -2 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -10 end{array} right) ⎝ . ⎛​010​130​450​−5−2−10​⎠ . ⎞​ . There are no solutions. . If the bottom instead looks something like this: .

            "content": "Chapter 33: Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply . The economy has some years in which activity increases and others where activity decreases A period of contraction is called a recession if it is mild and a depression if it is severe | . | The model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply can help explain how short-run fluctuations occur and are caused | . 33-1: Three Key Facts about Economic Fluctuations . Fact 1: Economic Fluctuations Are Irregular and Unpredictable . Fluctuations are often referred to as the business cycle in which business is good during times of growth and business is bad during times of contraction The term cycle is misleading, as the fluctuations do not follow a set pattern, and the economy can expand or contract seemingly randomly | . | . Fact 2: Most Macroeconomic Quantities Fluctuate Together . Quantities such as real GDP, income, profits, spending, etc. decrease when the economy contracts and increase when it expands Move in same direction but by different amounts | Contraction is mostly caused by reduced spending on new factories, housing, and investments | . | . Fact 3: As Output Falls, Unemployment Rises . If a firm decides to produce fewer goods, then they need to employ less people, so recessions often raise the unemployment rate | . 33-2: Explaining Short-Run Economic Fluctuations . The Assumptions of Classical Economics . Classical economics assumes that the amount of money and price levels does nothing to affect the economy; at the end of the day, the demand for jobs, food, etc. remains the same Thus, any changes in money are nominal, or insignificant, over time | . | . The Reality of Short-Run Fluctuations . Most economists believe that the classical economic theory applies to the world in the long run but not in the short run | In the short run, real and nominal variables affect each other and affect real GDP | Thus, to analyze economics in the short run, we must use a new model | . The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply . This new model of economic fluctuations focuses on two variables: the output of goods and services (represented by real GDP) and the average level of prices (represented by the CPI or GDP deflator) The model is called the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply which places the price level on the vertical axis and the output level on the horizontal axis | The aggregate-demand curve shows the quantity of goods demanded at each price level while the aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of goods sold at each price level | . | This model differs from the simple supply-demand curves because it covers multiple markets and products, not just one microeconomic market | . 33-3: The Aggregate-Demand Curve . Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward . Model of the curve: | Recall that the GDP can be represented using the following equation: Y = C + I + G + NX These variables all affect the aggregate-demand curve | Assuming that government spending is constant, we must exmaine how the price level affects the demand of goods and services for each of the variables | . | The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect A decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes consumers wealthier, thereby encouraging them to spend more. The increase in consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, an increase in the price level reduces the real value of money and makes consumers poorer, thereby reducing consumer spending and the quantity of goods and services demanded. | . | The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect If the price level is lower, then households need to hold less money, thus incentivizing investment | A higher price level discourages investment because households need to hold more money | Therefore, a lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending on investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, a higher price level raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, and decreases the quantity of goods and services demanded. | . | The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect A lower price level lowers the US interest rate, causing investors to invest abroad Abroad investing lowers the value of the dollar compared to the value of the euro, as firms must convert their dollars to euros (thus increasing the supply of dollars and lowering the supply of euros worldwide) | This change in currency values causes foreign products to become more expensive and domestic products to become cheaper, causing exports to increase and imports to decrease | . | Thus, when a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real value of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation stimulates U.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, when the U.S. price level rises and causes U.S. interest rates to rise, the real value of the dollar increases, and this appreciation reduces U.S. net exports and the quantity of goods and services demanded | . | Summing Up A fall in price level causes: Consumers to be wealthier, increasing the demand for consumption goods | Interest rates to fall, increasing the demand for investment | Currency to depreciate, increasing the demand for net exports | | The same applies in reverse, so if price levels rise, demand decreases | These explanations all assume that the money supply is fixed, and a changing money supply can shift the curve | . | . Why the Aggregate-Demand Might Shift . Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption If Americans en masse begin consuming less (more concerned about saving), then the aggregate-demand curve will shift to the left | If Americans en masse begin consuming more (less concerned about saving), then the aggregate-demand curve will shift to the right | Taxation is a big way to affect the level of consumption, as cutting or increasing taxes can heavily influence consumption | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment Many events can change the amount firms want to invest, including technological advancements, tax policy, money supply, etc. | An event that causes investment to increase shifts the curve to the right while an event that causes investment to decrease shifts it to the left | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases If the government begins spending more or less, then the aggregate-demand curve will shift | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports Events that cause exports to decrease shifts aggregate demand, such as an international recession, increase in value of the US dollar, etc. | . | Summing Up | . | . 33-4: The Aggregate-Supply Curve . Represents the quantity of goods and services that firms produce and sell at a given price level | It is important to know that the aggregate-supply curve is vertical in the long run but slopes upward in the shortrun | . Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Is Vertical in the Long Run . In the long run, an economy’s production of goods and services (its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and on the available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services. This means that an economy’s output will remain relatively constant in the long run save for advancements; tldr real GDP does not change | Price level does not affect real GDP because of monetary neutrality | However, the classical dichotomy and theory of monetary neutrality only applies in the long run, so the aggregate-supply curve is vertical only in the long run | . | . Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift . The natural level of output is the level of production that occurs when unemployment is at its normal/natural rate Also known as the potential or full-employment output | Changes in the natural level of output thus shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve which can be attributed to various factors | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor If an economy experiences an influx of workers, then there is more production in the economy, shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right (and vice versa if workers leave) | Any changes to the natural rate of employment through policy can also shift the curve, such as increases to unemployment insurance or better training for the unemployed | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital An increase in capital will increase productivity and thus increase the quantity of goods and services, shifting the curve to the right (and vice versa if capital decreases) | This observation applies to either physical capital (machines, factories) or human capital (college degrees) | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources Discovery of new natural resources can increase productivity and shift the curve to the right (and vice versa if some natural resources become unavailable) | . | Shifts Arising from Changes in Technological Knowledge As new techonology is developed and employed, producitivity increases in all sectors and shifts the curve to the right | Trade can act as a sort of “technological knowledge” while the prevention of certain methods can pose a reduction in technological knowledge | . | Summing Up Policies and events that affect the real GDP can also be described as affecting the long-run aggregate-supply curve | . | . Using Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply to Depict Long-Run Growth and Inflation . Over time, technological knowledge will advance and increase an economy’s natural level of output while the government will print more money and raise the price level, causing both inflation and a growing output | Recall that the short-run model of aggregate supply and demand will have fluctuations that vary away from the long run model Thus, the short-run fluctuations in output and price level discussed in this chapter should be viewed as deviations from the long-run trends of output growth and inflation | . | . Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run . The main difference between the long run and short run economy is the difference in the aggregate-supply curve in the short and long runs While the long-run curve remains unaffected by short-run changes in price level, the short-run curve is affected by such changes, causing it to slope upwards | Three main theories for why the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward, but all theories boil down to one basic reason: The quantity of output supplied deviates from its natural/long-run level when the actual price level in the economy deviates from the expected price level | . | The Sticky-Wage Theory This theory proposes that the short-run aggregate-supply curve is affected by price levels because nominal wages are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions (i.e. the wages are “sticky”) | Sticky wages can be attributed to long term contracts and social expectations of fairness and value | If the wages are set for a certain price level and the actual price level ends up being below the expected price level, then the workers are overcompensated and firms are forced to lay off more of them (and vice versa if the actual price level is above the expected one) | Eventually, this short term change goes away because wages readjust according to the equilibrium level | . | The Sticky-Price Theory This theory proposes that the short-run aggregate-supply curve is affected by price levels because nominal prices are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions (i.e. the prices are “sticky”) | A contributing factor to the stickiness of prices is the existence of menu costs and other similar costs | If prices are set for a certain price level and the actual price level ends up being below the expected price level, then the firm’s prices are too high and they must cut back on production in order to recuperate their losses (and vice versa if the price level is higher than expected) | Eventually, short-term unadjusted prices are readjusted to reflect the actual price level, and production returns to its equilibrium point | . | The Misperceptions Theory This theory hinges on the relationship between suppliers and markets | If the overall price level falls below the expected price level, then suppliers might mistakenly believe that their and only their prices have fallen in the economy, causing them to reduce the amount they supply (and vice versa if the price level increases) | Eventually, suppliers realize their misperceptions and adjust accordingly | . | Summing Up All theories suggest that output deviates from the natural level of output due to an inaccuracy in expected price levels, expressed mathematically as so (where a represents the reaction to changes in price level): | All theories also provide reasons as to why the long-run curve will correct back to being vertical | . | . Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift . All ways to shift the long-run curve apply to the short-run curve as well, as changes to production would affect both curves | Additionally, changes in expectations to the price level will shift the short-run curve For example, according to the sticky-wage theory, when the expected price level is higher, costs will be higher due to wages, causing firms to produce less at each price level, shifting the curve to the left (and vice versa for lower expected price levels) | . | Generally, an increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease in the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. | Summary: | . 33-5: Two Causes of Economic Fluctuations . To analyze fluctuations, let’s first assume that the economy begins in long-run equilibrium | . The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand . To analyze the effects of a shift, consider the following four steps Decide which curve the event shifts: aggregate demand or aggregate supply (or both) | Decude which direction the curve shifts | Use the diagram of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to assess the impact on output and price level in the short run | Use the diagram to see how the economy moves from its new short-run equilibrium to its new long-run equilibrium | | Suppose an event occurs that causes demand to be lower This event will shift the aggregate-demand curve to the left | In the new equilibrium, the level of output and price level will fall due to the shift | People will eventually come to match their expectations with the new price level, and the expected price level matches the actual one, thus causing wages + costs to drop and firms to start producing more again This will then lead the economy back to producing at the long-run aggregate supply curve quantity | . | Graph: | . | Assuming that the government does nothing, then the level of production will slowly return to where it once was, but the government can aid the aggregate-supply curve into shifting to the right in order to match the long-run curve faster | Three important takeaways In the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the economy’s output of goods and services | In the long run, shifts in aggregate demand affect the overall price level but do not affect output | Because policymakers influence aggregate demand, they can potentially mitigate the severity of economic fluctuations. | . | . The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Supply . Suppose that an event occurs that increases firms’ costs of production This will shift the aggregate-supply curve to the left, causing the level of output to decrease but the price level to increase | Because the economy experiences both stagnation (decreasing output) and inflation (increasing price level), the economy is experiencing stagflation | The response to this curve could be that workers demand higher wages due to the higher prices, causing the firms’ costs of production to become even higher, making the problem worse Known as the wage-price spiral | . | The spiral will eventually stop because the workers have less bargaining power due to the low supply of jobs, thus lowering nominal wages and causing production to return to higher levels (AKA the aggregate-supply curve shifts back to the right) | The government can aid this problem by shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right in order to keep output at its natural level | . | Two important takeaways Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession (falling output) and inflation (rising prices). | Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can mitigate the adverse impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the problem of inflation. | . | .",

            "title": "Money Growth and Inflation",
            "content": "Chapter 30: Money Growth and Inflation . 30-1: The Classical Theory of Inflation . The Level of Prices and the Value of Money . The value that people place on things typically don’t change, but the value of their medium of exchange does; this explains why prices change year after year | Let P represent the price level as measured by the CPI or GDP deflator, which means that P equals the price of a basket of goods and services 1/P thus represents the goods and services that can be bought with $1 | Therefore, P represents the price of goods and services in terms of money while 1/P represents the value of money in terms of goods and services | . | . Money Supply, Money Demand, and Monetary Equilibrium . The money supply can be represented by the amount of dollars that the Fed puts out into the public through the use of buying bonds, changing rates, etc. For simplification, ignore the money multiplier and only consider the raw amount of money the Fed puts out | . | The money demand is represented by the amount of liquid money that people want and is influenced the interest rates that people could get for storing their money elsewhere The most important factor for the demand of money is the average level of prices in the economy; if prices are high, then people will need to hold more money as opposed to when prices are low | . | The supply and demand for money are balanced in the long-run due to the overall level of prices If the price level is higher than the equilibrium level, people will want to hold more money than is available, so the price level must fall | If the price level is higher than the equilibirum, people will want to hold less money than is available, so the price level must rise | Graph: | . | . The Effects of a Monetary Injection . After a monetary injection, the price level rises because there is more money in the economy, making each dollar less valuable Graph: | A decrease in money will thus decrease price levels | This theory correlating the quantity of moeny to price levels is called the quantity theory of money | . | . A Brief Look at the Adjustment Process . The monetary injection immediately increased the amount of money in the economy from the point of equilibrium | After the injection, there is now a surplus of money, and people will try to get rid of this surplus by purchasing goods and services, loaning it out to others, or saving it in banks | The level of production in the economy has remained unchanged, so there is a greater demand for goods and services but not a greater supply | Thus, the price of everything increases and reaches a new equilibrium where the price level is higher | . The Classical Dichotomy and Monetary Neutrality . The effects of monetary changes on otheer variables has been closely studied and has led to the following | There are two types of economic variables: nominal variables which are measured in monetary units and real variables which are measured in physical units The income that a farmer gets for selling his crop is a nominal variable, but the amount of crop he harvests is a real variable | This separation of variables into two different categories is known as the classical dichotomy | . | Relative prices (three phones are worth the same as desktops) are also real variables | Real variables include real interest rate, real wages, and much more | Real variables remain uninfluenced by changes in the monetary system while nominal variables are affected Think back to real GDP; an economy’s production is reliant on physical capital which has nothing to do with the amount of money in an economy | . | Changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables but not real variables; known as monetary neutrality Thus, in the long run, monetary changes do not affect real variables, but in the short run, they can have effects on them | . | . Velocity and the Quantity Equation . The velocity of money is the measure of how often money is transferred in an economy Calculated by multiplying the price level P by the quantity of output (or GDP) Y and dividing the product by the quantity of money M | V = (P * Y)/M | Can be rewritten as MV = PY which is known as the quantity equation for relating the quantity of money M to the nominal value of output PY | . | The velocity of money is often stable and can be assumed to be constant | The quantity theory of money can make use of the velocity of money to come up with 5 main points: | . The Inflation Tax . Typically, governments rapidly create massive amounts of money in an effort to pay for their spending instead of raising taxes The printing of money causes an inflation tax; the value of everyone’s money decreases while the government takes in revenue from printing money | . | The inflation tax typically comprises of a very little portion of the government’s revenue, but the rapid printing of money (usually done by smaller governments) causes higher revenue | Hyperinflation ends once the government pursues a fiscal policy that does not require them to print money, such as by cutting government spending | . The Fisher Effect . An increase in the rate of money growth will raise the rate of inflation but not affect any real variable; can be applied to interest rates and policy regarding saving and investment | As defined before, the equation for real interest rate can be written as follows: Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate | This equation can be rewritten as so: Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation rate Since the real interest rate is unaffected by any monetary policy, this equation thus means that an increase in the nominal interest rate will reflect a change in the inflation rate | Therefore, when the Fed increases the rate of money growth, both the inflation rate and the nominal rate will increase in the long run | This effect is known as the Fisher effect | . | Graph showing a correlation between the nominal interest rate and inflation rate: | . 30-2: The Costs of Inflation . A Fall in Purchasing Power? The Inflation Fallacy . Inflation does not affect real purchasing power because of the principle of monetary neutrality | Prices rising means that the average price of goods and services increases but so, too, does the salary of workers as a result of the increased prices | . Shoeleather Costs . The inflation tax affects all holders of money, and people will try to get around this tax by holding less money in cash and saving money in accounts that accrue interest The cost of reducing the amount of money you hold is called the shoeleather cost of inflation, named after the wear of your shoes after making frequent visits to the bank but realting moreso to the time and energy spent going to the bank to reduce the inflation tax | Especially prevalent in countries with hyperinflation, as people have to go to the bank often to convert their currency into more stable currencies | . | . Menu Costs . Firms incur a cost when changing prices, known as the menu cost, due to the materials and resources used to decide on new prices, update price lists, advertise, etc. | Firms try to change costs as little as possible, but in an economy with hyperinflation, some may have to change costs multiple times a year | . Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources . Suppose that a restaurant only updates its menu once a year, meaning that the relative price of their menu items will be the cheapest at the end of the year when inflation has run its toll | The fact that the relative prices are always changing makes it difficult to efficiently allocate resources, thus creating a cost of inefficiency | . Inflation-Induced Tax Distortions . Inflation often raises the tax burden on savings Suppose that an investment of $10 from 50 years ago is sold today for $100, but the tax is based on the difference between’s today price and the price fifty years ago of $90; this is not indicative of the difference in real purchasing power which means that the tax is much greater than it should be | Table representing savings in an economy with no inflation versus an economy with high inflation: | . | One way to get around this distortion is to index the tax system based on changing price levels, but this is difficult and complicated to do | . Confusion and Inconvenience . People are often confused that their $20 cannot buy the same things that it could the year prior, thus creating a new cost | Applies to investing, saving, purchasing, etc. which causes the allocation of resources to be inefficient | . A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary Redistributions of Wealth . Inflation can cause wealth to be redistributed through loans If the inflation rate rises at a much higher rate than the agreed upon interest rate of the loan, then the borrower will have to spend less real purchasing power to pay it off | If the inflation rate is low or the economy deflates, then the borrow will have to spend more real purchasing power to pay it off | Impossible to avoid these effects because inflation is difficult to predict | . | Higher inflation rates mean that inflation in that economy is volatile and uncertain, thus causing worse arbitrary redistributions of wealth | . Inflation Is Bad, but Deflation May Be Worse . Some economists support the idea that a small, predictable amount of deflation is good because it would lower the cost of holding money and encourage more spending (known as the Friedman rule) | In reality, deflation has some of the same costs as inflation such as menu costs and inconvenience | Deflation also puts money into the hands of loaners (who are usually rich) instead of debtors (who are usually poor) | Deflation is often a marker of macroeconomic crisis | .",

Money: The assets in an economy that people use to regularly purchase goods and services from each other Cash, credit cards, etc. are considered money while houses, investments are not | . | . The Functions of Money . Three functions: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value | A medium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers in exchange for their goods and services | A unit of account is a method to compare the value of two goods in an economy In prisons and extremely poor nations, cigarettes are often used as a unit of account | . | A store of value is an item that people use to transfer purchasing wealth from the present to the future A seller receives money now so they can buy something else in the future | . | Liquidity is the ease of which an asset can be turned into a medium of exchange Money is the most liquid while houses, paintings, etc. are not as liquid | Must balance liquidity with store of value; money is very liquid but can lose value easily with inflation, while paintings can increase in value over time but are not very liquid | . | . The Kinds of Money . Commodity money is money that takes the form of a commodity that has intrinsic value Gold has historically been used as money because it has many uses, thus giving it a high intrinsic value | Economies using gold (or that can easily turn their currency into gold) are said to be under a gold standard | . | Fiat money is money without intrinsic value, such as paper bills Fiat money is established as money by governments, but the value of fiat money is highly dependent on the confidence of the public in the government issuing the fiat money | . | . Money in the U.S. Economy . Money stock represents the amount of money circulating in an economy, but there are many different ways to measure it Currency is always included in the measurement of the money stock, but other things like demand deposits (money that can be easily accessed from a bank account) should also be included | Things like savings accounts, purchasing power on margin, etc. could all be considered part of the money stock; makes it difficult to measure | . | For the rest of this book, the money stock will include currency and deposits in banks and other institutions that can be easily accessed to buy goods and services | . 29-2: The Federal Reserve System . The agency responsible for regulating fiat money is the Federal Reserve (Fed) which is an example of a central bank in the United States | . The Fed’s Organization . Headed by a Board of Governors and one chair with 14-year terms and who are appointed by the president Federal Reserve System consists of the Federal Reserve Board and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks around the country | . | The Fed has two jobs Regulate banks and make sure the banking system is healthy, which is done by monitoring banks’ actions, loaning money to banks, and acting as a lender of last resort to failing banks | Control the quantity of money supply, or money available in the economy, through monetary policy | . | . The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) . The FOMC consists of all of members of the Board of Governors and all presidents of the regional banks Only 5 of the regional presidents get to vote with the votes rotating, but the New York branch president always gets to vote because NYC is considered the financial center of the United States | . | The FOMC decides to increase or decrease the number of dollars in the economy through open-market operation, or the sale and purchase of US government bonds If they want to increase money, they purchase bonds (money out, bonds in); if they want to decrease money, they sell bonds (money in, bonds out) | . | The Fed’s decisions regarding money supply highly infuence inflation in the long run and employment + production in the short run | . 29-3: Banks and the Money Supply . The Simple Case of 100-Percent-Reserve Banking . Assume that there is only 100 dollars of currency, so the total supply of money is 100 dollars, and one bank that only takes deposits + doesn’t make loans Money that banks have received but not loand out are reserves | Because all deposits are treated as reserves, this system is called 100-percent-reserve-banking | . | The money in the bank can be represented with a T-account which is an accounting statement showing liabilities and assets Because the assets and liabilities are equal, this is considered a balance sheet | Because all deposits are kept in reserves, the supply of money remains unchanged; thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money | . | . Money Creation with Fractional-Reserve Banking . When a bank begins using the money in the reserves to give out loans, they keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve; thus, they are practicing fractional-reserve banking The fraction of deposits kept in reserves is known as the reserve ratio, and the Fed typically sets a minimum amount (called a reserve requirement) for the reserve ratio so bank runs don’t occur | Banks can also hold more than the reserve requirement for safety; known as excess reserves | . | Assume that the same bank uses a reserve ratio of 1/10, leading to this T-account: The amount of liabilities remains unchanged because making loans doesn’t change the amount the bank has to pay back to their depositors | The bank now has two assets: reserves and loans Loans effectively increase the money supply by $90, as there are 90 more dollars for borrowers to use | . | When banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money | . | Technically this doesn’t “create money”, as borrowers also take on liabilities by taking the loans, but the money in the economy becomes more liquid | . The Money Multiplier . Assume that the person who took the $90 from the first bank purchased something from a seller who deposited it into another bank The T-account for the secound bank would then look like this: | The total liabilities is $90 because the person deposited $90 and the bank can then loan out $81 out of the $90 | . | This pattern would continue if someone took a loan out from the second bank and bought from a member of a third bank: | Eventually, the total money supply jumps to $1000 after money is loaned out and reused again (100 + 90 + 81 + 72.90 + … + 0.9n * 100) The amount of money that the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier (10 dollars for each dollar) | The money multiplier is equal to the reciprocal of the resrve ratio Therefore, the lower the reserve ratio, the higher the money multiplier is and vice versa | . | . | . Bank Capital, Leverage, and the Financial Crisis of 2008–2009 . The example in the last two sections has been simplified, but most bank balance sheets also include equity and debt The resources that a bank gets from issuing equity to its owner is called bank capital which is used to make profit for its owners through actions such as purchasing stocks and bonds | . | Here is a T-account of a more realitic bank: The right side includes all of the liabilities and capital | The money on the right side is used to fund the items on the left, and the two sides must balance because of the rules of accounting | . | Businesses rely on leverage, or borrowing money in order to fund themselves and invest in capital | The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank’s total assets to the bank capital; in the above example, this ratio is 1000 to 50, or 20 This means that for each $20 of assets, $19 are financed with borrowed money | Assume that the value of the bank above’s assets rise by 5% This means that the assets are now worth $1050 while the liabilities remain the same (value of deposits and debt stay the same) | The owner’s equity now becomes $100 (1050 - 950) and thus increases by 100%, so a 5% increase turns into a 100% increase for owners | The opposite also applies; if there is a 5% decrease, then the owner’s quity goes down 100% as well | If the value of assets ever fall below the value of the liabilities, then tthe bank is considered insolvent and unable to pay off its debts in full | . | . | Banks are required to hold a certain amount of capital known as a capital requirement so they are guaranteed to pay off their depositors Illustrated in 2007 and 2008 crisis where the value of assets decreased so heavily that banks could no longer pay off their depositors and were forced to not loan out their money | Solved by adding money back to the economy which, in turn, made taxpayers partial owners of banks | . | . 29-4: The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control . How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves . Open-Market Operations Open-market operations is when the Fed buys or sells government bonds to decrease or increase the money supply, respectively | Easiest to do and does not require changes to laws or policy; used the most often | . | Fed Lending to Banks The Fed can lend money to banks, which happens most commonly when banks lack reserves | Banks typically borrow money from the Fed through the Fed’s discount window and pay an interest rate on the loan called the discount rate Giving banks money allows the banking system to create more money | Changing the discount rate changes the money supply; higher discount rate discourages banks from borrowing, thus decreasing the supply, while the opposite happens when the discount rate is lowered | . | Another way for the Fed to give money is through Term Auction Facitlities where loans were created and given to the highest bidder who would pay back the highest interest rate | The Fed lends money to banks when financial institutions are in trouble, such as during financial crises | . | . How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio . Reserve Requirements The Fed can change the reserve requirements which state the minimum amount of money the banks must hold in reserve | Increasing the requirement increases the reserve ratio which decreases the money supply, and vice versa for decreasing the requirement | Reserve requirements are rarely changed because they can cause banks to stop loaning money out and are less effective due to the common practice of holding excess reserves | . | Paying Interest on Reserves The Fed pays interest on reserves that banks hold at the Fed, thus encouraging saving money in reserves | The higher this interest rate, the more reserves are held and the lower the reserve ratio is; vice versa applies | . | . Problems in Controlling the Money Supply . There are two main issues that arise with attempting to control the money supply The Fed cannot control the amount of money that households decide to deposit into banks Especially problematic if a large number of households decide to take out their money and run the bank; causes issues without the Fed being able to do anything | . | The Fed cannot control the amount that banks lend to people Banks might decide to stop loaning money for an arbitrary reason outside of the Fed’s control, thus lowering the money supply | . | . | These two problems illustrate the dependence of the economy on the behavior of both banks and households, but they can be mitigated through careful observation | . The Federal Funds Rate . The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge one another for loans These loans are typically short and only used for small injections | Different than the discount rate, as banks are borrowing from other banks instead of the Fed Discount rate and federal funds rate is typically pretty similar | . | The federal funds rate influences the entire market due to its effects on banks | Open-market purchases raise the federal funds rate while open-market sales decrease it (less money means more banks need loans and vice versa) | A decrease in the target goal for the federal funds rate means the money supply will increase while an increase in the target goal signals a decrease in money supply | . | .",

            "content": "Zhou Enlai Big figure in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was the first Premier of the People’s Republic of China and eventually became Foreign Minister | Headed China’s diplomatic strategy, especially with Africa (Afro-Asian Friendship) during the 1950s-1960s | His life is representative of the role of Third World countries in international politics and international relations between such countries | . | Zhou’s Early Life Lived in northeast China during his early life and traveled to Japan in 1917 for his studies; learned English there | 1919 - Moves back to China and joins nationalist + leftist student groups after mass protests occur due to growing European influence | 1920 - Zhou studies in France and joins the CCP, creates a link between the Chinese diaspora in Europe and the mainland Chinese party (CCP) | 1924 - Returns to China to build revolution | Very similar to Tan Malaka in the sense that both men became communist after studying abroad (in Europe) | . | The Chinese Path to Communism In the 1920s, China was considered one state but was controlled by different forces (middle of China controlled by warlords while foreign powers controlled the coast) The Guomindang (Chinese Nationalist Party, or KMT) formed to unify China by expelling foreign powers and forming a strong central government; supported by the Soviet Union | . | 1923-1927 - CCP allies with the Guomindang, similar to “bloc within” strategy where CCP members were encouraged to join the Guomindang | Guomindang splits into a right and left wing faction, with the left wing being closer to the CCP and the Soviet Union | 1927 - The right wing faction take over the Guomindang and kill the communists The Soviet Union demands that the CCP remain loyal to the Guomindang, creates tension between the Chinese and Soviet parties, disillusions many Chinese communists with the Comintern | Mao Zedong ignores Soviet advice; CCP must abandon cities, relocate to countryside, unite with the peasantry, and create areas in the countryside to use as bases to fight the Guomindang with guerilla warfare | . | Maoism becomes a separate part of communism (a brand of Chinese communism) because of his new strategy of working with the “common man” to defeat the Guomindang (control the countryside to cut off the cities) Mao gains power within the CCP and the CCP pursue his strategies throughout the 1930s and 1940s | . | . | Sino-Soviet Split 1949-1958 - China is closely allied with the Soviet Union and is reliant on Soviet military aid and loans; Zhou Enlai, as premier and foreign minister, negotiates with Moscow | Tension rises because Soviet and Chinese communism differs, especially with regards to peasantry Soviets argue for collectivization, government takes control of the peasantry + agriculture to drive profits and create industry | Chinese wants to work with the peasantry instead of “extracting profits” from them; use loans instead of countryside to industrialize and build infrastructure | . | Stalin dies in 1953, and in 1956, the new Soviet leader, Khrushchev, denounces Stalin as a tyrant who murdered his people and distorted the message of communism Khrushchev creates a more liberal period of Soviet politics with less authoritarianism; calls for policy of “peaceful coexistence” with the West | Mao believes that Khrushchev is selling out to the West and that his criticism of Stalin will weaken his power in China | . | 1958-1960 - Sino-Soviet Split, China and Soviet tensions become public and the two countries sever ties as they vie for world power | . | Afro-Asian Friendship Throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, Zhou creates a new strategy of international diplomacy between China and the newly independent states of Asia and Africa China wanted to be a nation that was equally unaligned with the Soviet Union and US, a sort of intermediary, that allied with other nations that wanted to remain neutral | . | 1955 - Bandung Conference, gathered Asian and African leaders and called for a policy of “non-alignment” in the Cold War Zhou presents China as an ally of anti-imperilaism and a defender of national independence for Third World countries | Focuses more on anti-imperialism instead of communism in order to quell fears of Soviet or Chinese invasion of the Third World | . | 1963-1964 - Zhou Enlai travels throughout Africa on a publicized trip as a diplomat Worked with Nkrumah, the president of Ghana, who used some communist policies but was not communist | Nkrumah supported Pan-Africanism; wanted unity and cooperation throughout all of Africa | Zhou and Nkrumah’s meeting detailed the alliance of Third World countries to break away from dependence on First World countries | Focused on international institutions (such as the United Nations) as a way to pursue Third World interests | . | China’s closest African ally is Tanzania 1965 - Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere visits China and likes the idea of Maoism being applied to his own country | China supports Tanzania, trains their people to engage in guerilla warfare | . | . | The Cultural Revolution 1966-1976 - Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, started by Mao to get rid of his opponents and connect with the new, young generation | Young people took up Mao’s cause, Mao’s opponents were often subject to torture and death | Zhou was seen as a moderate alternative to Mao but remained an ally to Mao; died after diagnosed with bladder cancer with Mao refusing him medical treatment | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 27: The Basic Tools of Finance . 27.1: Present Value: Measuring the Time Value of Money . The present value of a future sum of money is the amount of money that would need to be saved today in order to reach that future sum via interest rates | The future value of a current sum of money is the amount of money that it would be worth after a number of years due to interest rates | Typically, the present and future values of money are calculated assuming that interest is compounded After n years and an interest rate of r, $100 becomes 100 * (1 + r)n dollars | The opposite is also true; if you receive 100 dollars n years from now, then the present value of that 100 becomes 100/(1 + r)n | . | The present and future value of money can be applied to many things, such as investments or receivement of payments | . Chapter 28: Unemployment . 28-1: Identifying Unemployment . How Is Unemployment Measured? . Adults (defined as people aged 16 or older) are placed into one of three categories when considering unemployment Employed - Anyone working, whether full-time or part-time, or those taking a temporary absence such as vacation, sickness, etc. | Unemployed - Anyone not employed, currently available for work, and trying to find employment for the past 4 weeks; also includes those who were laid off but are still working for the company | Not in the labor force - Anyone not in the above two categories, such as students, retirees, or homemakers | . | The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed Labor force = Number of employed + Number of unemployed | . | The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people divided by the size of the labor force Unemployment rate = Number of unemployed / Labor force * 100 | . | The labor-force participation rate measures the proportion of adults working in the labor force Labor-force participation rate = Labor force / Adult population * 100 | . | Between different groups of people, the unemployment rate and labor-force participation rate differ | The unemployment rate typically fluctuates The rate at which the unemployment rate hovers is called the natural rate of unemployment, while the deviations from the natural unemployment rate are called cyclical unemployment | Graph: | . | . Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It to Measure? . Measuring unemployment is not straightforward, as movement into and out of the labor force is common 1/3 of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force, such as young workers who are looking for their first jobs or old workers who want to reenter | Almost half of all unemployments end when the unemployed person leaves the labor force | Some who say they’re unemployed might be doing so in order to get unbemployment benefits | Some who leave the labor force are discouraged workers, or people who tried hard to get a job and failed | . | . How Long Are the Unemployed without Work? . Unemployment can be considered as follows: Most spells of unemployment are short, but most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term. | This means that there are people who are chronically unemployed that make up a majority of the unemployed, but most people who are unemployed regain jobs quickly and don’t affect the unemployment rate over time | . Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed? . There is always unemployment because there is always a surplus of labor; four reasons for this | Frictional unemployment explains shorter spells of unemployment that occur due to the delay of matching workers to jobs | Structural unemployment explains longer spells of unemployment that occur because the wages are set above the value defined by the labor-wage equilibrium This chapter will explore three types: minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages | . | . 28-2: Job Search . Job search is defined as the processs of matching workers with appropriate jobs Not an instantaneous process which is why unemployment occurs | . | . Why Some Frictional Unemployment Is Inevitable . Fricional unemployment occurs due to changes in demand of labor among different firms If Firm A increases in popularity and its competitor Firm B does not, then Firm B will lay off workers and Firm A will hire workers, causing a period of unemployment | If one industry experiences an increase in demands while another one experiences a decrease, then workers from the declining industry must search for jobs in the new one This is known as a sectoral shift and causes periods of unemplopyment due to the time it takes to find new jobs | . | In general, changes in demand between different industries and companies inevitably creates frictional unemployment | . | . Public Policy and Job Search . Though frictional unemployment is inevitable, how much it happens is not; the internet and faster flow of information can decrease frictional unemployment The government has tried to facilitate job search in many ways, such as government run agencies and public training programs (which trains workers in failing industries to get jobs in better ones) | Advocates claim that these programs help because it expands the labor force and reduces unemployment, while critics claim that the private market can do a better job than the government (such as through advertising or private education) | . | . Unemployment Insurance . Unemployment Insurance is the practice of giving workers protection against job loss; only given to those who were laid off and cannot find new jobs | Causes frictional unemployment because those who are unemployed are less inclined to find a new job if they know they can get money for doing nothing There are benefits: workers are less likely to take less lucrative job offers, thus increasing the quality of jobs, and workers find better matching jobs for their tastes | . | Point of much contention; economists are unsure of whether or not removing unemployment insurance would boost or diminish economic well-being | . 28-3: Minimum-Wage Laws . Minimumm wage laws cause unemployment because it forces wages to be above the equilibrium level, causing a surplus of jobs and unemployment Graph: | . | Though minimum wage laws do cause unemployment, they do not affect most people, as a majority of workers make well above the minimum wage Minimum wage affects the “marginal worker”, or those who have the least experience and the least skill | . | The graph shows an important conclusion: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any reason, the result is unemployment. | Note that minimum wage is very different from job search; while those searching for jobs are simply finding the best jobs to suit their tastes, those affected by a surplus of labor are waiting for jobs to open up because there is too much labor | . 28-4: Unions and Collective Bargaining . Unions are groups of workers who bargain with employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions Less prevalent in the US today, but still very active in Europe | . | . The Economics of Unions . Unions can be thought of as cartels but for labor Cartels are groups of sellers who join together to fix prices and exert market power; unions do the same but instead of selling goods they sell labor | The process of unions and firms agreeing on terms of employment is called collective bargaining | . | The bargaining power of unions largely comes in the form of strikes where all of the workers of a union stop working Because firms don’t want to lose profit, they will often strike agreements with unions to prevent strikes | . | The actions of unions raise the wage above the equilibrium level, resulting in a surplus of labor and unemployment Workers who are employed at the higher wage are better off, but those who were employed and got laid off are worse off | Those who maintain employment are called insiders and those who did not get the union jobs are called outsiders | Outsiders can either remain unemployed and try to get inside jobs or find jobs in other firms that are not unionized Because more workers look for jobs in un-unionized firms, the wages of such firms decreases; thus, unions increase wages in some parts of an industry while lowering it in others | . | . | Public policy allows for unions to exist, though the existence of unions is often debated politically | . Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy? . Critics of unions argue that unions are cartels, and by exerting their power, unions raise wagees too high and cause workers to be unemployed This causes an inefficient allocation of resources because higher wages reduces employment down to an inefficient level | Also inequitable; some workers benefit from the existence of unions while others do not | . | Advocates for unions argue that workers need market power of their own to combat the market power of firms, such as when firms create company towns or have overwhelming market presence otherwise Unions also help firms efficiently address workers’ concerns because they act as a means of communication between the two, leading to a happier and more productive workforce | . | . 28-5: The Theory of Efficiency Wages . Efficiency wages represent the idea of keeping wages above equilibrium to increase efficiency in various ways | . Worker Health . Workers who are paid more have a better diet, can afford health services, etc. which boosts their productivity Especially prevalent in poorer countries where firms are concerned that cutting wages too low will cause bodily harm to their workers | . | . Worker Turnover . Workers have incentives to quit their jobs, such as moving, finding a new job, leaving the labor force, etc. | By having higher wages, the firms encourage workers to stay and reduce turnover Turnover is detrimental for many reasons; have to train new workers, have to spend resources to hire new workers, etc. | . | . Worker Quality . The most talented, experienced workers want wages that are high to compensate, so companies will pay higher wages in order to weed out workers who might not be the most skilled for the job and only receive highly skilled applicants | . Worker Effort . Often, workers have the ability to determine how hard they work, and firms have a hard time figuring out whether or not a worker is shirking or not | Higher wages thus incentivize workers to stay on tasks in order to maintain their job and | .",

key disconnect between Marx and Engels’ idea of communism being born from a capitalist state | The Comintern was created to unite communists worldwide in order to develop communism in Western Europe | By 1920, the Bolsheviks are isolated both politically and geographically | . | Communism in the East The Soviets turn to Asia and support anti-colonist struggles in Asia to spread communism | The Comintern held a meeting in Azerbaijan with representatives from various movements throughout Asia Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the Comintern, calls for an alliance between the western proletariat and the peasantry of Asia | . | By creating a common enemy in Western Europe (colonizers), the Soviets create an alliance with Asian states | The idea of anti-colonialism contradicted with classic communism, as anti-colonialists were often wealthy and part of the native bourgeoisie The native bourgeoisie did not want to become communist; they simply wanted more power and were thus more conservative than revolutionary | The Comintern debated over this contradiction, as there was a lot of contention over the issue of hypocrisy | . | Before the Russian Revolution, much of Southeast Asia was colonized by Europeans | . | Communism and Pan-Islamism in the Dutch East Indies The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was founded in 1920 and was initially dominated by Dutch activists | The Islamic Union (SI) was a pan-Islamist organization that was anti-coonial Thought it was originally formed to protect Indonesian merchants, it expanded to recruiting poor peasants and working class | . | Many members of the PKI joined the SI and shared the same anti-colonist views, but they maintained their own separate identities Used the Comintern’s “bloc within” strategy where communists joined anti-colonial organizations to further their cause but maintained separation | . | . | Tan Malaka Indonesian (known then as the Dutch East Indies) communist, born in Java | Map of his travels: | Born into an aristocratic family and learned Dutch, different European languages | Becomes interested in communsim after studying in Netherlands, joins socialist teachers’ union | When returning to the Dutch East Indies, he joins the PKI and is active in gaining support for it within the SI | 1921: Elected chairman of the PKI, arrested and exiled a year later Extremely popular in the Netherlands, almost wins an election and gains support inside of the Comintern | . | Advocated for the marriage of Pan-Islamism and communism in order to further their cause, especially in Asia, in a speech to the Comintern Communist propaganda typically were anti-Islamic, Malaka wants them to ally with them | Defends “bloc within” strategy and criticizes the Comintern’s judgemental attitude towards Islam | Argues that Islam is a historically progressive religion and aligns with Christianity as an Abrahamic religion Communism could extend Islam’s progressive legacy in East Asia | . | . | Comintern is impressed with Malaka, appoints him as their representative in Indonesia | 1923: Malaka goes to Guangzhou, China to organize communist activities throughout Southeast Asia | 1925-1927: relocates to Manila, Philipines | Two brutal events in 1927 Comintern support a PKI uprising against the Dutch to which Malaka disapproves; the uprising fails and the party effectively dies for 7 years | Chinese communists are killed by the native bourgeoisie and flee to the countryside to avoid death | . | Malaka breaks off with the Comintern due to his belief that it had become a vehicle for Russian foreign policy | 1927-1941: Malaka attempts to found communist parties throughout SE Asia before returning to Indonesia during Japan’s occupation during WWII | 1945-1949: Japanese are defeated, and the Dutch attempt to reestablish authority which causes a war between Indonesian nationalists and the Dutch Malaka creates a left-wing faction within the independence movement, in direct conflict with right-wing revolutionaries and is executed by Indonesian authorities in 1949 | . | . | Main Points The Russian Revolution created the first communist state which was meant to act as a spark for the rest of the world | Failure of revolution in Europe caused the Comintern to look towards anti-colonial struggles in Asia | Communism in Asia transforms the idea of communism, causes Malaka to use Islam to support the cause | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 26: Saving, Investment, and the Financial System . The financial system consists of the institutions that match one person’s savings with another perosn’s investments Think of banks; people can deposit money into banks, and the banks use that money to give loans out | . | . 26-1: Financial Institutions in the U.S. Economy . Various incentives for people to both save and borrow, so the financial system matches the two together | Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: financial markets and financial intermediaries | . Financial Markets . Financial Markets are institutions where people who want to save can directly give funds to people who want to borrow Two main financial markets: bond and stock market | . | . Bond Market . When a company wants to borrow money, they can sell bonds to do so | Bonds are essentially IOU agreements, and the bond buyer loans money to the bond seller | Bonds identify the date of maturity, or when the loan will be repaid, and the rate of interest the seller will pays until the loan matures and the principal, or initial amount borrowed, is paid off | Bonds have four different characteristics that differentiate them Term: How long it will take for the bond to mature; occasionally, this will be indefinite, and such a bond is called a *perpretuity Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because you might need the money back faster, so long-term bonds usually have higher interest rates | . | Credit Risk: The likelihood that the bond seller will fail to pay the interest or principal Failure to pay is called a default, and corporations with higher chances of defaulting will issue junk bonds which have high interest rates in the hopes that someone will buy their bond | . | Tax Treatment: The way that taxes affect the interest earned on a bond State or local government issued bonds called municipal bonds are not taxable, so they have lower interest rates than corporate or federal bonds | . | Inflation Protection: Whether or not a bond will increase the interest paid back over time to reflect changes in inflation Bonds with inflation protections typically pay a lower interest rate than those without it | . | . | . Stock Market . A stock is a piece of the company that one can purchase in order for the company to raise funds | Selling stocks to raise money is known as equity finance, while the sale of bonds is called debt finance | Stockholders will gain a profit if the company they hold stock in is profitable while bondholders will not, but if the company does poorly, then the bondholders will maintain their same interest rates while stockholders will have stocks with a lower value Overall, stocks are more risky but more lucrative | . | After a corporation begins selling stocks, the shares are traded amongst stockholders on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ The price of shares depends on the supply and demand of the stock | . | A stock index is the average of a group of stock prices, such as the SNP 500 or Dow Jones Inudstrial | . Financial Intermediaries . Financial intermediaries are institutions in which savers indirectly provide money to borrowers Two main types: banks and mutual funds | . | . Banks . Banks use deposits from people who wants to save and uses it to finance loans from borrowers | Banks are profitable because the interest rates on their loans are higher than the interest rates they pay back on deposits | Banks also provide a medium of exchange in the form of credit/debit cards which allow people to easily make transactions Included in this is that they allow for a store of value for wealth that people have saved | . | . Mutual Funds . Mutual funds are institutions that sells shares to the public and uses the money raised to buy a portfolio of different stocks and bonds Shareholders of a mutual fund accept the risk associated with the portfolio; if it rises in value, then they benefit, but if it falls, then they suffer the loss | . | One advantage of mutual funds is that they allow those with small amounts of money to diversify their holdings, as it’s difficult to buy a fraction of a stock share | Another advantage is that it gives ordinary people access to the skills of professional portfolio managers, thus making it a more effective use of money This advantage is controversial, as it is often difficult to “beat the market”, and typically, index funds outperform mutual funds | . | . 26-2: Saving and Investment in the National Income Accounts . Various macroeconomic variables affect the financial markets, and this section will focus on using accounting to calculate the effects of these factors | . Some Important Identities . GDP is total income in an economy and the total expenditure on the economy’s goods and services Therefore, GDP (Y) is divided into the four components of expenditure: consumption (C), investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX) | Y=C+I+G+NX{Y = C + I + G + NX}Y=C+I+G+NX | . | Making an assumption that an economy is a closed economy that does not engage in trade makes it easier to analyze this identity In closed economies, there is no trade, so NX = 0 | Y=C+I+G{Y = C + I + G}Y=C+I+G | Therefore, every output sold in an economy is consumed, invested, or bought by the government | . | Using algebra we get the following: Y−C−G=I{Y - C - G = I}Y−C−G=I | . | Y - C - G is the total income in the economy that remains after consumption and government pourchases, which is also known as national saving or saving (S) Thus, S=I{S = I}S=I | . | Let T represent the amount that the government collects in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form of transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare) With T, we can define S as S=Y−C−G=(Y−T−C)+(T−G){S = Y - C - G = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)}S=Y−C−G=(Y−T−C)+(T−G) | . | This splits saving into private saving (Y - T - C) and public saving (T - G) Private saving is the income (Y) households have left over after paying taxes (T) and consumption (C) | Public saving is the tax revenue (T) the governments has left over after paying for its spending (G) If T &gt; G, then the government has a budget surplus, and if T &lt; G, then the government has a budget deficit | . | . | The identity that S = I reveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving must equal investment This is done through financial intermediaries that turn savings into investment | . | . The Meaning of Saving and Investment . Investing refers to the purchase of new capital, such as a loan to buy a new house or build a building | Saving refers to excess income that is stored somewhere, whether it’s the stock or bond market | . 26-3: The Market for Loanable Funds . Assume that the economy has one financial market which is called the market for loanable funds Loanable funds refers to the income that people chose to save and lend out which investors borrow to fund new investment projects | In this market, there is one interest rate which is the equal to the return to saving and the cost of borrowing | . | . Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds . The supply in this market comes from those with extra income who wish to save and lend out, either directly (bonds/stocks) or indirectly (banks) In other words, saving is the source of supply for loanable funds | . | The demand in this market comes fromm households and firms who wish to borrow in order to invest, such as getting a mortgage on a house or building a new factory In other words, investing is the source of demand for loanable funds | . | The interest rate represents the price of a loan, as it is the amount that borrowers pay for their loans and the amount lenders receive for loaning Higher interest rate means less people will borrow and more will save, and lower interest rate means more people will borrow and less will save | An equilibrium occurs in the market: if the interest rate were lower, then more people will borrow causing lenders to raise the interest rate, and vice versa | Graph of supply vs. demand: | . | The interest rate in this market refers to the real interest rate rather than nominal | Similar to other markets, we can analyze different government policies and their effects on saving and investment based on the shifts in supply and demand | . Policy 1: Saving Incentives . Saving is vital to creating resources for capital accumulation and raising the GDP, thus leading to policies incentivizing saving Tax laws especially can be amended to encourage saving, such as putting a lower tax on bond interest payments | . | A policy that incentivizes saving will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right because more money will be saved and lent out This will thus lead to a lower interest rate and more investment | Graphic: | . | . Policy 2: Investment Incentives . An investment tax credit gives a tax advantage to a firm investing in capital, thus incentivizing investment | This policy would shift the demand of loanable funds to the right because more people will borrow in order to make investments Therefore, this policy will lead to a higher interest rate and greater saving | Graphic: | . | . Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses . If the government runs a budget deficit, then there is a lower supply of loanable funds because national saving is equal to private saving plus public saving Therefore, the supply of loanable funds will shift to the left because there is a lower amount of national saving | This causes a higher interest rate and less investment | Graphic: | The fall in investing due to government borrowing is called crowding out because, when the government borrows to finance its deficit, it “crowds out” private borrowers and investors | The negative effects of a budget deficit can be felt regardless of whether it was caused by excess government spending or tax cuts | . | If the government runs a budget surplus, it uses its savings to get rid of its government debt which contributes to national saving Thus, a budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 25: Production and Growth . Different countries have different levels of productivity and different GDPs | This chapter focuses on ways that these statistics can vary from country to country | . 25-1: Economic Growth Around the World . Consider the following table: | Clearly, there are differences in GDP between various countries, but a few things stand out Countries don’t always stay on top: The UK was the richest country in the world but is now behind US, Canada, and Germany | Countries don’t always stay poor: Japan, China, and Brazil have experienced incredible growth, taking them for poorer nations to middle-income/rich ones | . | This table shows that things can vary greatly, but what drives these changes? | . 25-2: Productivity: Its Role and Determinants . Why Productivity Is So Important . Consider an isolated economy that must sustain itself through its production and no foreign trade | The higher said economy’s productivity is, the higher its quality of life More goods produced means more abundance which means free time, specialization, etc. | . | Note that an economy’s GDP measures both total income and total expenditure, so GDP is often a good measure of quality of life for economies Higher GDP means more production | . | . How Productivity Is Determined . Different factors can affect an economy’s ability to produce | Physical Capital Workers are more productive if given tools to work with | The stock of equipment and structures used to produce goods and services is called physical capital, or often just capital | Consider a bakery; the baker requires a rolling pin, baking sheets, an oven, etc. to efficiently produce baked goods These factors of production are included in physical capital | . | Physical capital can also be used to create more physical capital; a miner mines ore to create nails to build a house | . | Human Capital Human capital refers to the knowledge and skills worker gain through education, training, and experience | A better quality of human capital means a higher productivity | Producing human capital requires labor and time, such as teachers, libraries, study, etc. | . | Natural Resources Natural resources refers to inputs into production that are found in nature, such as water, wood, land, etc. Renewable resources include forests, animal husbandry, etc. | Nonrenewable resources include oil and minerals | . | Differences in natural resources are a big factor for some of the differences in productivity US has great farmland, Middle East has a lot of oil, etc. | . | Some countries without many natural resources, like Japan, can thrive through international trade | . | Technological Knowledge Technological knowledge refers to the understanding of the most efficient ways to produce goods and services | Two types Common knowledge, such as the invention of Henry Ford’s assembly line; can be employed by everyone | Proprietary, such as Coca-Cola’s secret recipe; often patented and only used by the company who discovered it | . | “Technological knowledge is the quality of society’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the population has spent reading them. | . | . 25-3: Economic Growth and Public Policy . The following section details different policies governments can adopt to improve productivity | . Saving and Investment . Physical capital is a produced factor of production, so devoting more resources towards it can help improve future production Consider a country that uses all of its labor to make food; its production remains stagnant because it doesn’t improve | If said country used half of its labor to make tools, then in the following year, it would be able to produce more food using the new tools | . | In general, saving and investment can enocourage growth and improve an economy’s standard of living in the long run | . Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect . If a government passes a new saving rate, how long will they enjoy an increased rate of growth? | Economists believe that (the saving of) physical capital is subject to diminishing returns, so the more you have, the less benefit you get from saving more This property is also known as the diminishing marginal product of capital | Graph: | . | In the long run, a higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income but no to higher growth in those areas According to economic studies, the increased growth from a higher saving rate can last for decades | . | The presence of diminishing returns leads to the catch-up effect where smaller countries can grow at a faster rate than more established ones For example, the US and South Korea both had the same saving rate in 1960, but South Korea grew by a lot more due to its smaller size | . | Though the catch-up effect leads to more rapid growth, bigger countries will remain bigger because they had more capital to start with | . Investment from Abroad . Two types of foreign investment Foreign direct investment occurs when a capital investment is owned and operated by a foreign entity ex: Ford Motor Company creates a new factory in Mexico | . | Foreign portfolio investment occurs when a capital investment is owned by a foreign entity but operated by domestic residents ex: said factory is run by Mexicans | . | Both types increase the stock of capital in Mexico | . | Foreign investments happen because investors expect a return on their money, so the profit made from a domestic factory might be split between foreign investors and residents Still, these investments increase the GDP of the country the factory is in | The GDP measures production and income while the GNP measures only income, so the GDP will increase by more than the GNP due to the cut investors take | . | Investment from abroad is beneficial because it increases productivity and allows poorer countries to understand better technologies | The World Bank encourages investment from abroad into underdeveloped countries to promote stability | . Education . Schooling can increase one’s wages and standard of living considerably, so government policy encouraging schooling can increase the standard of living | Education incurs an opportunity cost; students could have used the time spent in school working in the work force | Some economists argue that human capital is especially important because it confers positive externalities such as the production of new technologies | Poorer countries face the issue of brain drain, or the common practice of educated workers emigrating to richer ones for better wages and a higher standard of living Said workers might not come back to their countries of origin to improve its GDP | . | . Health and Nutrition . Human capital can also refer to public health | Healthier workers are more productive compared to undernourished ones For instance, height has been correlated with higher productivity, and nutrition is a direct cause of height | . | The link between health and wealth creates a vicious cycle; poorer nations have lower productivity and thus less healthy workers which leads to lower productivity The opposite also occurs; wealthier nations have higher productivity and thus healthier workers which leads to higher productivity | . | . Property Rights and Political Stability . Production relies on the interactions between millions of individuals and firms, and the economy must coordinate said interactions through market prices | For pricing to work, economies must have a system of property righs which encourage trade and leads to set prices If property rights don’t exist, then everyone would steal, thus the justice system enforces laws and contracts | . | Underdeveloped countries often lack the ability to enforce property rights, leading to fraud, corruption, and crime Political instability threatens the existence of property rights, as it is unclear whether or not said rights can be enforced | . | Politically stable countries with good governments thus have higher productivity | . Free Trade . Some countries try to use inward-oriented policies which attempt to increase productivity through a lack of interaction with foreign countries Supporters of said policies advance the infant-industry argument and are often distrusting of foreigners | . | Most economists believe that poorer countries are better off using outward-oriented policies which can act as a sort of technology If a country has an abundance of wheat and can trade that wheat for computers, they effectively have technology which turns wheat into computers | Countries that encourage free trade thus experience a high rate of growth equivalent to a technological advance | . | Countries with inward-oriented policies must produce everything (food, textiles, technology, etc) by itself, leading to inefficiency | Countries with seaports and easy access to trade often prosper more than countries without them | . Research and Development . Advances in technological knowledge is a big reason why the quality of life today is better than ever | Technological advances often come from private firms, but said advances are, to a large extent, a public good that can be used by many people | Because of this, the US government encourages the research and spread of new technologies, as seen in programs such as NASA | The patent system encourages research and development for financial gain | . Population Growth . The effects of population growth have been long debated Larger populations lead to more production because of the increased amount of labor | Larger populations lead to higher consumption which can decrease the standard of living at large | . | Population growth also affects factors of production in other ways | Stretching Natural Resources Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outpace the production of food, thus leading to “misery and vice” | Malthus’ theory was incorrect largely due to his failure to account for technological advances in food production | . | Diluting the Capital Stock Some theorize that high population growth reduces the GDP per worker because more workers causes capital, both physical and human, to be spread more thinly | This is most prevalent in poorer countries where the population growth is 3% compared to 1% in developed countries like the US Some countries, like China, forced population growth down through their one-child policy | . | Income equality can encourage population growth to decrease due to the increased opportunity cost of bearing a child | . | Promoting Technological Progress The more people there are, the more geniuses, engineers, scientists, etc. there are to help improve technology This theory has been supported by articles and studies in the past | Larger populations grow at a faster rate due to the discovery of technological advancements | . | . | .",

Consumer price index (CPI): The measure of the overall cost of goods and services bought by a typical consumer | . How The CPI Is Calculated . The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses a few steps to calculate the CPI | . Fix the basket The prices most important to the typical consumer are taken into account | Goods and services that are purchased more are given a greater weight when calculating the CPI | Important goods and services found through surveys | . | Find the prices Find the prices of the baskets’ goods and services at each point in time that you want to caluclate | . | Compute the basket’s cost Use the data on the prices and multiply each price by the good/service’s weight | . | Choose a base year and compute the index After choosing a base year, you can calculate the CPI by comparing the price of a basket from the current year to the base year | ∣CPI=Price of basket of goods and services in current yearPrice of basket in base year∗100∣| { text{CPI} = { text{Price of basket of goods and services in current year} over text{Price of basket in base year}} * 100 } |∣CPI=Price of basket in base yearPrice of basket of goods and services in current year​∗100∣ | . | Compute the inflation rate Can use the CPI to calculate the inflation rate from year to year | ∣Inflation rate in year 2=CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1CPI in year 1∗100∣| { text{Inflation rate in year 2} = { text{CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1} over text{CPI in year 1}} * 100 } |∣Inflation rate in year 2=CPI in year 1CPI in year 2 - CPI in year 1​∗100∣ - Example of following the steps: - The CPI is useful to find the cost of living for the average consumer - The core CPI is similar to the CPI except it excludes food and energy, as they have higher volatility - The producer price index (PPI) measures the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by producers rather than consumers | Changes in PPI are often thought to be useful to predict changes in CPI | . | Problems in Measureing the Cost of Living . There are many issues with the CPI that are difficult to solve | Substitution Bias Some prices might rise higher than others, and if said prices become too high, then consumers will substitute those expensive goods and services with cheaper ones | Because the goods and services are substituted, the goods and services in the basket change weight drastically, but the base year always uses a fixed basket, so the CPI might not reflect these new changes | . | Introduction of New Goods If a new good is introduced, then the buying power of a dollar increases | Since the basket is fixed to a base year, the new product that is introduced is not included in the basket, and the CPI does not accurately reflect the new change | . | Unmeasured Quality Change A good or service can increase or decrease in quality without the price of it changing | Quality is hard to measure and thus cannot be accurately reflected in the CPI | . | The accuracy is extremely important for the government; services such as Social Security give out money based on the CPI Economists argue on how to balance it to make it more accurate | . | . The GDP Deflator versus the Consumer Price Index . The GDP deflator and the CPI both reflect changes in prices, but there are two key differences between them The GDP deflator reflects the prices of all goods and services produced domestically while the CPI reflects the prices of all goods and services purchased by consumers For instance, if the price of oil increases, then the CPI will rise much more than the GDP deflator | . | The weighting of the GDP deflator and the CPI differs The CPI does not change the goods and services in its fixed basket, but the GDP deflator measures all currently produced goods and services so it changes more often | . | . | . 24-2: Correcting Economic Variables for the Effects of Inflation . Dollar Figures from Different Times . You can calculate the value of a dollar using the following formula Amount in today’s dollars=Amount in year T dollars∗Price level todayPrice level in year T{ text{Amount in today&amp;#x27;s dollars} = text{Amount in year T dollars} * { text{Price level today} over text{Price level in year T}} }Amount in today’s dollars=Amount in year T dollars∗Price level in year TPrice level today​ | . | . Indexation . A price that is corrected to reflect inflation is said to be indexed, and indexation is typically done through a law or a contract | Many laws use indexation, such as Social Security | . Real and Nominal Interest Rates . An interest rate means that your money increases over time, but the purchasing power of said new dollar is effected by inflation | If your money increases through an interest rate, it may have less or more purchasing power if the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate | Two types of interest rates: nominal interest rate, which does not correct for the effects of inflation, and real interest rate, which does Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate | . | .",

The GDP measures market prices to reflect the value of goods sold and purchased | . “…of all…“ . The GDP attempts to measure the market value of every single good sold or purchased in an economy Housing is measured by the rental price of the home or, if the house is not being rented, the estimated rental price of the home | . | The GDP does not measure illegal products, such as drugs, or products manufactured and consumed in homes, such as a backyard tomato garden This can lead to situations where a marriage can lower a GDP if a consumer and producer get married | . | . “…final…“ . Goods can either be intermediate or final Intermediate goods are used in the process of making a final good; think the corn used in making a tortilla | Final goods are the end product of a production process; the tortilla | GDP only measures the value of final, not intermediate goods | . | The GDP does measure intermediate goods if it is added to an inventory for use at a later time Essentially, additions to an inventory add to the GDP, and when those additions are used at a later time, they are subtracted from the GDP | . | . “…goods and services…“ . Both goods (food, books, video games, etc) and services (haircuts, car wash, concerts, etc.) are included in a GDP | . “…produced…“ . GDP only includes goods and services currently produced, not ones produced in the past If a car manufacturer creates a car, the value of that car is added to the GDP | If someone sells an old car to someone else, the valur of that car is not added to the GDP | . | . “…within a country…“ . The GDP measures the production inside of the geographical boundaries of a country, regardless of the citizenship or nationality of the producer | . “…in a given period of time.” . The GDP measures the value of production in an interval of time, which is typically either a financial quarter or year Reporting for a GDP for a quarter is typically multiplied by 4 to represent an “annual rate” | Quarterly GDP data is typically adjusted in order to account for seasonal changes, such as shopping sprees in December | . | With these clarifications, the definition of GDP has multiple layers Theoretically, the GDP should be equal to the gross domestic income (GDI), but the difference in GDP and GDI can be chalked up to a statistical discrepancy | . | . 23-3: The Components of GDP . The GDP can be understood as a sum of four different types of spending | Y = C + I + G + NX Y represents GDP | C represents consumption | I represents investment | G represents government purchases | NX represents net exports | . | . Consumption . Consumption is spending by households (aka citizens/regular people) on goods and services Does not include housing purchases, as those count as an investment | Services include haircuts and medical care, and goods include food, clothing, appliances, etc. | . | . Investment . Investment includes the purchase of goods (known as capital goods) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services | Includes business capital, residential capital, and inventories/stock Business capital: business structures (like factories), equipment, and intellectual property products (software or recipes) | Residential capital: buildings for rent, personal residences | Inventory: components, ingredients, intermediate goods | . | Investment, in this case, does not refer to financial investments such as stocks and bonds; it refers to goods that will be used in the future to create more goods and services | . Government Purchases . Government purchases includes spending on goods and services by all types of governments Includes salaries of government workers and expenditure on public works | Known officially as government consumption expenditure and gross investment but known traditionally as government purchases | . | Social Security benefits or unemployment is not considered part of government purchases; they are instead defined as transfer payments These are not specified as expenditures because no value is being extracted from the production of goods or services; thus, they are not part of the GDP | . | . Net Exports . Net exports = exports - imports | Net refers to the subtraction of imports from exports in order to show the amount exported Selling a domestic product to a foreign buyer increases GDP, while purchasing a foreign product domestically decreases it | . | . 23-4: Real versus Nominal GDP . If total spending rises from year to year, either a) more goods and services were produced or b) the price of goods increased To measure quantity of goods instead of a change in price, economists use real GDP which uses a market price baseline of a set year | . | . A Numerical Example . Example table of an economy which produces hot dogs and hamburgers: | The total expenditure can be simply found by multiplying the current market price by the current quantity of goods sold The production of goods and services valued at current prices is called the nominal GDP | In the table, the nominal GDP for hot dogs and hamburgers continually increases, but this increase can be attributed ot both the increase in price and the increase in production | . | Real GDP removes the issue of price changes by valuing goods and services at a set price based on a previous year Using 2019 as the base year, we can calculate the value of goods and services using the 2019 market price in order to account for any changes in price | For the base year, the real GDP will always equal the nominal GDP | . | Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. | Real GDP is a better measurement of economic well-being because it consistently tracks the level of production between years; real GDP is used to determine economy growth | . The GDP Deflator . The GDP Deflator is calculated as follows: ∣GDPDeflator=NominalGDPRealGDP∗100∣| { GDP Deflator = {Nominal GDP over Real GDP} * 100 } |∣GDPDeflator=RealGDPNominalGDP​∗100∣ | . | This equation allows us to see how the prices of goods and services have changed compared to the base year If the prices remain the same from the base to current year, then the GDP deflator remains constant | If the prices increase or decrease from the base year, then the GDP deflator will also increase or decrease accordingly | . | . 23-5: Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic Well-Being? . GDP tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy, and in most cases, this tells us about the economic well-being of the average person (more expenditure = more money = happier) | Some disagree that GDP is a good measure of economic well-being, as it does not measure any intangibles such as happiness, bravery, creativity, etc. GDP, though not directly connected, can indirectly measure these traits | More GDP = more education, better nutrition, more specialization for a country | . | GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being Production can unnaturally increase (everyone begins working every day of the week), thus increasing GDP but decreasing well-being | Does not include goods and services produced at home, such as a chef’s home-cooked meals, volunteer work, or the work of stay-at-home parents | Does not measure environmental factors, such as pollution | Does not measure distribution of income; a nation with 100 people making 50k has the same GDP as a nation with 1 person making 5 million and 99 people making 0 | . | In general, GDP is a good measure of well-being for most, but not all, purposes | .",

            "content": "Chapter 16: Monopolistic Competition . 16-1: Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition . Monopoly and perfect competition are two extremes; most markets fall in the middle under imperfect competition | An oligopoly is a market with a few sellers that offer relaitively similar products offered by other sellers Oligopolies can be measured using a concentration ratio, or the percent supplied by the four largest firms in a market | Higher concentration ratios = better described as oligopolies | . | Monopolistic competition refers to markets with many firms selling similar but not identical products Contains three main attributes Many sellers - there are many firms selling to the same group of customers | Product differentiation - each firm produces a product that is unique to other firms, so each firm is not a price taker | Free entry and exit - firms can enter and exit the market, so the number of firms adjusts until economic profit equals zero | . | . | Graphic showing the differences between the types of markets: | . 16-2: Competition with Differentiated Products . The Monopolistically Competitive Firm in the Short Run . Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market can be treated like a monopoly; they face downward-sloping demand curves and produce the quantity at which the marginal revenue equals marignal cost | Graphs showing the curves for two monopolitically competitive firms: | . The Long-Run Equilibrium . The situations depicted in the above graphs don’t last long, as firms making a profit encourages new firms to enter while firms taking a loss encourages firms to exit Less firms = higher price and vice versa | . | Firms in the market eventually reach an equilibrium where they are making zero economic profit Graph showing the curves of a long-run monopolistically competitive firm: | Note that the demand curve is tangent to the average total cost curve at the profit-maximizing quantity | . | Monopolistically competitive markets share some traits with monopolies and perfect competition As in a monopoly, price exceeds marginal cost. This is because the profit-maximizing point is when marginal revenue equals marginal cost and the marginal revenue must be lower the price due to the downward-sloping demand curve | As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost due to the free entry and exit of firms | . | . Monopolistic versus Perfect Competition . Graphs showing the differences between a monopolistic competitive and a perfect competitive firm: . | Two main differences: Excess Capacity and Markup . | . Excess Capacity . The slope of the demand curve is negative and the price that monopolistically competitive firms offer is when the demand curve is tangent to the average total cost curve This means that firms produce less than the quantity at the efficient scale, as the efficient scale has a slope of zero | The difference between this lower quantity and the efficient scale quantity is known as the excess capacity, as perfectly competitive firms could produce more and lower the total average cost | Monopolistically competitive firms cannot produce more, as it lowers the price too much | . | . Markup over Marginal Cost . Price is higher than marginal cost because a monopolistically competitive firm has market power, but they don’t make profit because they are operating below their efficient scale | Monopolistically competitive firms want more customers because that means they receive more profit (price is greater than marginal cost) while perfectly competitive firms don’t care (price is equal to marginal cost) | . Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society . One source of inefficiency is the markup; some customers value a good more than the marginal cost but less than its marked up price Hard to fix this issue, as legislation would need to target all firms that create different products | Additionally, if you remove markup, firms are forced to operate at a loss | . | Another source of inefficiency is that the number of firms may be inefficient because the entry of a firm has external effects The product-variety externality: Consumers get consumer surplus because there is more variety in the market | The business-stealing externality: Other firms in the market get a lower market share, thus lowering producer surplus | Based on these externalities and their magnitude, a market may have too many or too few firms | . | Though there are inefficiencies associated with monopolistic competition, they are difficult to fix and improve upon | . 16-3: Advertising . The Debate over Advertising . Critics argue that advertising is more psychological than informational, and advertising impedes competition by exaggerating the differences in products, thus creating a more inelastic demand curve to profit off of | Defenders argue that advertising is a way to provide information to customers, making them more privy to their options It can also enhance competition because new firms can more easily enter and customers are more informed | . | . Advertising as a Signal of Quality . If a firm has a bad product, then they won’t spend money on advertising because consumers won’t repurchase their product after trying it | If a firm has a good product, then they will spend money on advertising because it establishes a customer base who repeatedly purchases their product | Therefore, advertising can serve as a way to show customers which products are good and which are bad | . Brand Names . Some argue that brand names are detrimental because it accentuates unnoticeable differences between products | Defenders argue that brand names provide information about the quality of a product and encourage prestigous companies to maintain the quality of said product | . Chapter 17: Oligopoly . A market with few sellers that sell identical (or similar) products is called an oligolpoly | Because there are few sellers, each firm must use game theory to cooperate and determine how much of a product they should produce | . 17-1: Markets with Only a Few Sellers . A Duopoly Example . Picture a town with two water sellers Both sellers incur no marginal cost to produce another gallon of water, and the demand curve of water is downward-sloping | . | The demand schedule of water for the town: | . Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels . Let’s suppose that the sellers are in a perfectly copmetitive market The price would equal the marginal cost, so the price would be zero because the marginal cost is zero | The equilibrium quantity would be 120 gallons | . | Let’s suppose that a monopoly owns the water The highest profit is when the monopoly sells 60 gallons of water at $60 each | This result is inefficient because the monopoly produces below the efficient quantity of water | . | The best decision for the duopolists is to produce at the profit maximizing quantity If the sellers agree to sell 30 gallons each, this agreement is called collusion and the sellers working together are called a cartel | Cartels essentially act as monopolies | . | . The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly . Oligopolists would like to act as a cartel, but self-interest often overrides and lowers profit | Assuming that the two water sellers start at the profit maximizing quantity, one water seller might be inclined to sell more water in order to increase their profit Currently, each makes $1,800, but if one seller increases production to 40 gallons, then the price falls to $50, thus netting a profit of $2,000 | . | If both sellers think this way, then the total quantity of water would be 80 gallons and the price of water would be $40 | The sellers would refuse to sell more because they lose profit instead Raising production to 50 gallons lowers the price to $30, meaning that the new profit is $1,500 instead of $1,600 | . | The outcome of 40 gallons is called the Nash equilibrium, or the point at which both firms choose the best strategy based on actions and strategies of the other firm | Self-interest means that firms produce more than a monopoly would but less than perfectly competitive firms would | To summarize: when firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize profit, they produce a quantity of output greater than the level produced by monopoly and less than the level produced under perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly price but greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal cost). | . How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects the Market Outcome . Assume that the two water sellers grows to four, and each seller must decide on a new quantity to produce | The decision made will be based on two effects The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling another gallon of water at the current price will increase profit | The price effect: Raising production increases the quantity sold and lowers the price of water | . | The oligopolists will continue/stop producing water until the price effect and output effect balance each other out, unable to affect the other firms’ production | The more firms in the market, the less of an impact a firm can have on the market price Thus, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows, the more perfectly competitive the market becomes. The price approaches marginal cost, and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level. | . | . 17-2: The Economics of Cooperation . The Prisoners’ Dilemma . Two convicts are given the option to either confess or stay silent Payoff matrix showing the different outcomes based on confessing or staying silent: | . | Regardless of the actions of the other person, the convict should always confess, as confessing will always net them a benefit (20 years vs. 8 years and 1 year vs. 0 years) This strategy is a dominant strategy because it is the best strategy regardless of the actions of the other player | . | Both prisoners thus confess, resulting in a Nash equilibrium where they both spend 8 years in prison Worse than the optimal solution, but better than the worst case scenario | . | . Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma . A payoff matrix can also be drawn for the situation of the water sellers: | Suppose that both firms decide on a starting point of 30 gallons and have the option to either stay at 30 gallons or increase to 40 gallons The situation resembles the Prisoners’ Dilemma: the dominant strategy is to raise production to 40 gallons, as it always increases profit regardless of the actions of the other firm | . | . Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma . Arms Races - The US and USSR both decided to stockpile weapons because it was the dominant strategy Payoff matrix: | . | Common Resources - Two oil companies should build more drills on shared land because it ensures the most amount of profit Payoff matrix: | . | . The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare of Society . The equilibrium derived from the Prisoners’ Dilemma can be detrimental to society The arms race caused both countries to be in danger while the abundance of drills produced less oil in the long run | . | Oligopolists’ lack of cooperation in maintaining monopoly-level production is a good thing, as it means that the quantity produced is closer to the socially efficient outcome | . Why People Sometimes Cooperate . The prisoners’ dilemma situation can be won if the game is repeated over and over again Suppose that the two water sellers can set their production every week | If they only could set it once, then they would both produce 40 gallons, as it is the dominant strategy | If they repeated the situation over weeks, then they would realize that producing 30 gallons is more profitable and agree to doing so This requires a caveat; if the agreement is broken, then the other firm will retaliate by producing 40 gallons | . | $1,800 &gt; $1,500, so in the long run, the firms will reach an agreement and maximize profits | . | . 17-3: Public Policy toward Oligopolies . Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws . Though contracts are typically good for an economy, a contract between competitors that makes a market less competitive has been outlawed over centuries Take the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts which prohibit the “restraint of trade” that increases profits for firms | The Justice Department and private parties can sue and enforce these antitrust laws to prevent firms from making markets less competitive | . | . Controversies over Antitrust Policy . The actions that antitrust policies can prohibit have been debated | . Resale Price Maintenance . A firm that sells a price to stores at $50 and forces them to sell it at $75 is engaging in resale price maintenance | Theoretically, it reduces competition because the price cannot be lowered | Defenders state that resale price maintenance isn’t meant to reduce competition, as the original firm would instead reduce the wholesale price instead of the selling price if it wanted to be more powerful | Additionally, the markup in cost might have a legitimate goal; sellers might be required to have a showroom highlighting the quality of the firm’s product that is paid for by the markup | This scenario highlights that business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate purposes | . Predatory Pricing . A big firm might try to force a smaller firm out by cutting its prices and incurring a loss to protect its market share | Thought it could reduce competition, the big firm must lose money and produce more product at the new price (because a lower price causes a higher demand) This could thus hurt the bigger firm more than the samller firm | . | Hard to tell when a price cut is competitive and when a price cut is predatory | . Tying . A firm might try to sell two products together at a single price, an action called tying | The Supreme Court banned the practice on the grounds that firms could exert more market power by selling more of its product (some of which might be undesirable) | Economists argue that this argument is untrue; if consumers are willing to pay a high price for one product and lower price for the other, then the practice of tying means that the single price must be close to the price of the higher quality product anyways | Tying could act as a form of price discrimination; if two consumers value the two products differently but have a similar willingness to pay for both of them, then firms could tie the products to maximize profit | .",

            "title": "Monopoly",
            "content": "Chapter 15: Monopoly . 15-1: Why Monopolies Arise . Monopoly: A firm that is the sole seller of its product which has no close substitutes Caused by a barrier to entry; other firms cannot enter the market and compete | Three main barriers to entry: monopoly resources, government regulation, and production process | . | . Monopoly Resources . A monopoly can arise if a firm has sole access to a key resource For example, a small town might only have one well; the owner of said well has a monopoly | Famous example is DeBeers, a diamond company that controls 80% of diamonds produced | . | Monopolies rarely arise because of access to a key resource, as most resources are freely available | . Government-Created Monopolies . Monopolies can arise when the government provides one person or firm the sole ability to sell a product The two most important ways the government does so is through patent and copyright laws | . | Though the laws create a monopoly which is undesirable compared to a competitive market, they also encourage research and development | . Natural Monopolies . A natural monopoly occurs when a single firm can supply a good or service at a lower cost than two (or more) other firms combined Naturally monopolistic companies have constant economies of scale | . | Industries with natural monopolies are hard to enter; new firms cannot produce at as low of a price and compete | Smaller markets are more condusive to natural monopolies, as the profit from competing with existing firms has a lower potential | . 15-2: How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions . Monopoly versus Competition . The key difference between competitive firms and monopolies is that monopolies can control the price of the output while competitives firms (price takers) cannot The demand curve for a competitive firm is elastic, as they can produce any quantity and have people buy at that price | The demand curve for a monopoly slopes downward, as higher quantities induce lower prices and vice versa | Figure: | . | . A Monopoly’s Revenue . Consider a water producer with the following statistics: Note that the marginal revenue is always less than the price of the good This is because monopolists lose money on earlier sales while gaining revenue at the new price | When you go from a quantity of 3 to 4, your price drops by a dollar; you lose $3 on the original quantity while increasing revenue by the price * one unit | . | . | When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two effects on total revenue (P x Q): The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher and the total revenue increases | The price effect: The price is lower, so P is lower and the total revenue decreases | . | Marginal revenue is positive when the output effect outweighs the price effect but is negative when the price effect outweighs the output effect | Graph of Demand Marginal Revenue Curves: | . Profit Maximization . Graph of relevant curves for a monopoly: . Similar to competitive firms, monopolies choose the level of production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost Low quantity = lower marginal cost = increase quantity produced | High quantity = high marginal cost = decrease quantity produced | . | Unlike competitive firms, the marginal revenue is always lower than the price Competitive firms: P = MR = MC | Monopolies: P &gt; MR = MC | . | Therefore, to choose the price of the product, monopolies create the quantity at which MR = MC and determine the price using the demand curve | Because the price is greater than the marginal cost for monopolies, a social cost is created | . A Monopoly’s Profit . Similar to competitive firms: Profit (P) = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC) | P = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q | P = (Price - ATC) * Q | . | Graph that shows a monopoly’s profit: | . Main Steps to Maximize a Monopoly’s Profit . Derive the MR curve using the demand curve | Find the quantity at which MR = MC | On the demand curve, find the price that matches the quantity | If the price is greater than the average total cost, the monopoly profits | 15-3: The Welfare Cost of Monopolies . The Deadweight Loss . The quantity the maximizes total surplus is the found at the intersection of the supply curve (or marginal cost curve) and the demand curve Figure: | . | The quantity that the monopolist chooses is the one that maximizes profit which is at the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost Recall that marginal revenue is always lower than price (or demand) | Thus, monopolies produce lower than the efficient quantity. | This causes a deadweight loss because some consumers might value the price above the monopoly’s cost but below its price | Graph: | . | The deadweight loss caused by monopolies is similar to a tax; it drives a wedge between supply and demand Instead of creating revenue for the government, it creates revenue for the monopoly | . | . The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost? . The fact that the firm profits does not mean that there is a social cost; it simply means that producers benefit more than consumers However, because monopolies produce less than is efficient, there is a social cost | . | There is a caveat to this: if monopolies use their profits to maintain their monopoly, then all producer surplus is lost and the deadweight loss grows bigger | . 15-4: Price Discrimination . Price discrimination: Selling the same good at different prices to different customers | . A Parable about Pricing . If one party values a good more than another party, then a monopoly would want to try to sell their product at a higher price to the party that values it more This eliminates deadweight loss, as parties unwilling to buy a good at a higher price will buy the good at a lower one | Increasing the amount sold is equivalent to increasing the quantity; the inefficiency of monopolies is lessened because they produce more | . | . The Moral of the Story . Price discrimination is a rational decision to maximize profit | To price discriminate, firms must be able to separate customers by their willingness to pay (either by geography, method of buying, etc.) Adding on to this, there must be some measure in place to prevent arbitrage, or buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another at a higher price | . | Price discrimination can raise economic welfare, as more consumers purchase the product Note that all increases in surplus are producer-side; they make more profit while consumers purchase goods at their willingness to buy (resulting in zero consumer surplus) | . | . The Analytics of Price Discrimination . Perfect price discrimination is when a monopolist knows each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge them accordingly Assuming the monopolist can perfectly price discriminate, the following graphs can be made: | . | All marginal consumers get the product at their value, and the monopoly pockets all surplus | Imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or not affect the total surplus in a market All that is certain is that price discrimination increases the monopoly’s profit, as firms would only price discriminate if there was a benefit | . | . Examples of Price Discrimination . Movie Tickets - Though the marginal cost of selling a theater seat is constant, there are discounts for kids and seniors | Airline Prices - Depending on the timing of your flight, you might be charged more because you are a businessperson and value a flight more | Discount Coupons - Richer people won’t use coupons and stores can make a bigger profit off of them because of that | Financial Aid - Wealthy families have a higher willingness to pay and thus don’t receive aid so the college can make the most money | Quantity Discounts - The more of a good you purchase, the lower your marginal willingness to pay is, so stores sell in bulk | . 15-5: Public Policy Towards Monopolies . Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws . If two big companies wish to merge, then the Department of Justice analyzes the deal before approving, as the union of two big companies could result in a monopoly Horizontal merges are typically blocked, as they remove all competition | Vertical merges are allowed because it doesn’t remove competition; it just makes one firm more efficient | . | Laws such as the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts allow the government to prevent mergers | Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, but mergers can also create more efficient methods of production It’s up to the government to decide if a merger is beneficial or not, and critics question the government’s decisionmaking abilities | . | . Regulation . Governments regulate the behaviors (typically through pricing) of monopolies, usually focusing on natural monopolies like water or electricity | The price the government sets is difficult to determine A low price could cause the firm to incur a loss, forcing them to exit the industry | A high price (that results in zero economic profit) might not be the profit maximizing quantity for a firm, causing a deadweight loss | . | A regulated price also gives the monopolist no incentive to lower their costs, as they can’t make a higher profit | . Public Ownership . Governments have the option to run a natural monopoly itself Common in European countries where the government owns telephone, water, and electric companies | The US runs the Postal Service | . | Private monopolies are preferred to public monopolies, as private ones have an incentive to lower costs and become more efficient while public ones are slowed by the bureaucracy | . Doing Nothing . Policies aimed at reducing monopolies have drawbacks, and some economists argue that it is most efficient to allow monopolies to flourish | . Summarizing Graphic . .",

            "content": "Chapter 14: Firms in Competitive Markets . 14-1: What is a Competitive Market? . The Meaning of Competition . Competitive markets (aka perfectly competitive markets) have two characterstics There are many buyers and sellers | The goods offered by different sellers are mostly the same | Anonther, optional, condition is thought to characterize competitive markets: a firm can freely enter or exit the market | . | . The Revenue of a Competitive Firm . Suppose there is a dairy farm that produces Q quantity of milk at P price Total revenue = P x Q | Since the farm is small as an individual firm, the price doesn’t change as more dairy is produced | . | Table representing profits at different quantities: The average revenue is the revenue divided by the amount of output, which represents the price For all types of firms, average revenue equals the price of the good. | . | The marginal revenue is the change in revenue for each additional unit of output, which also represents the price because the price is fixed For competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good. | . | . | . 14-2 Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm’s Supply Curve . A Simple Example of Profit Maximization . The following table represents different profits at different quantities: The dairy farm wants to choose the quantity which makes the most profit (revenue - total cost) which would be 4 or 5 gallons of milk | Can also analyze when the marginal revenue is no longer greater than or equal to the marginal cost (Does it cost more to make a gallon of milk than the revenue we’d make? Is the revenue from the gallon of milk greater than its cost?) | . | . The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm’s Supply Decision . Take into account the curves from last chapter which represented marginal cost, average total cost, average variable cost, and more: Remember that the price is the same as average and marginal revenue (AR and MR) | At Q1, the marginal cost is less than the marginal revenue, so the firm should produce more in order to realize a greater profit | At Q2, the marginal cost is greater than the marginal revenue, so the firm should produce less in order to prevent losses | . | This analysis provides three rules for maximizing profit If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its output. | If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its output. | At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue equals marginal cost. | . | If the price were to rise, then the firm would produce a higher quantity in order to make more profit, and if the price were to fall, then the price would produce less The marginal cost curve therefore determines the quantity of good that a firm is willing to produce at any given price; similar to a supply surve with an elastic demand | . | . The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down . A shutdown is the decision to seize production during a period of time due to market conditions, while an exit refers to a long-term decision to leave a market Shut down firms still have to pay fixed costs while exiting firms don’t have to pay any costs at all | Some of these costs can be opportunity costs; if a farmer doesn’t plant crops on his land, then the land is doing nothing and becomes a sunk cost If he instead decides to sell the land, then he exits the market and does not pay this sunk cost | . | . | A firm will shut down if its total revenue would be less than any of its variable costs of production Represented by TR (Total Revenue) &lt; VC (Variable Costs) | Can be rewritten as TR/Q &lt; VC/Q | Remember that TR/Q = P (Price) and VC/Q = AVC (Average Variable Costs) | Therefore, a firm should shut down if P &lt; AVC | . | Visual Representation: | . Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs . A sunk cost is a cost that has been committed and cannot be recovered; should not be included when making decisions | When deciding whether or not a firm should shut down, we must assume that the firm’s fixed costs are sunk in the short run and should be ignored when making a decision | Relates to the adage “don’t cry over spilt milk”; can’t do anything about a sunk cost | . The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market . Exiting a market means that you save both variable and fixed costs of production, so a firm exists a market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than the total costs of production Represented by TR &lt; TC (Total Cost) | Can be rewritten as TR/Q &lt; TC/Q | TC/Q = Average Total Cost | Therefore, a firm should exit if P &lt; ATC | Additionally, a firm should enter if P &gt; ATC | . | Visual Representation: | . Measuring Profit in Our Graph for the Competitive Firm . Recall that Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost Can be rewritten as Profit = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q | Profit = (P - ATC) * Q | . | This way of looking at profit allows us to measure profit in the graphs: | . A Brief Recap . . 14-3: The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market . In the short run, it’s unreasonable to assume that firms can easily enter or exit a market, but in the long run they can, so the number of firms will adjust accordingly | . The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed Number of Firms . Consider a market with 1,000 identical firms; each has the same marginal cost curve, so the amount supplied will change depending on the price’s position on the curve Graphs: | . | . The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit . Assume that everyone has access to the same technology for producing a good and access to the same markets to buy the inputs for production In this scenario, all current and future firms have the same cost curves | . | If the firms in a market are profitable, then more firms will enter the market and decrease prices and profits | If the firms in a market are losing money, then firms will exist the market and increase prices and profits | These two forces will balance out, and firms that remain in the market will make zero economic profit | Recall that Profit = (P - ATC) * Q Since all firms are making zero economic profit, the price and average total cost must be driven to equality over time | . | Firms maximize profit by choosing a quantity where their marginal cost is equal to the price, and the force of entry and exit ends when average total cost is equal to price Thus, marginal cost and average total cost must equal each other which is where the average total cost is at its lowest This point is called a firm’s efficient scale | . | Therefore, in the long-run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at their efficient scale | . | Graph: | In the long run, the only price consistent with zero profit is the minimum of average total cost, and all firms must be price takers at this price, creating an elastic supply curve | . Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business If They Make Zero Profit? . Recall that total costs include both implicit and explicit costs Implicit costs are not seen in cash; they are opportunity costs | If the opportunity cost of the capital to create a farm is $80k/year of interest, then that might be the profit a farmer makes each year, leading to zero economic profit | . | . A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run . Let’s say that a new scientific study increases the demand for milk The price becomes higher than the minimum ATC, and firms realize a short term profit | . | As the market becomes more profitable, more firms enter, driving down the price and profits of milk | As more firms enter, the price goes back down to the minimum ATC, but the quantity produced and consumed of milk is higher than before | Figure: | . Why the Long-Run Supply Curve Might Slope Upward . There are two reasons why the long-run market supply curve might slope upwards instead of being perfectly elastic The resources used in production are available only in limited quantities There is limited land that you can purchase for farming, and as more farms are created, the price of land goes up as well | This means that the input cost of farms goes up, leading to an increase in price and an upwards slope | . | Firms might have different costs Consider the painting market, where different painters are skilled | Newcomers have a higher cost because they are less skilled, and if the quantity demanded of painters increase, then the price needs to increase as well to make these newcomer firms profitable | Low cost firms make more of a profit, creating an upwards sloping supply curve | . | . | In both scenarios, some firms profit even in the long run because the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the marginal firm (new firms who would exit quickly if the price was lower) | Despite these factors, for the most part, because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve. | .",

A binary relation on set is reflexive if and only if, for every x in the set, xRx | A binary relation on set is anti-reflexive if and only if, for every x in the set, it is not true that xRx Both properties are universal statements, so to show one or the other, you must show that xRx is true/false for one element | If some of the elements are related to themselves and some are not, then the relation is neither reflexive nor anti-reflexive | . | A relation on set is symmetric if and only if, for every pair x,y, xRy if and only if yRx In other words, xRy and yRx are both true or neither xRy and yRx are true | . | A relation on set is anti-symmetric if and only if, for every pair x, y, xRy and yRx are not both true In other words, these three conditions are met: xRy, but it is not true that yRx | yRx, but it is not true that xRy | Neither xRy nor yRx is true | . | . | A relationship is transitive if and only if, for every three elements x, y, z, if xRy and yRz then xRz | Example on how to prove (or disprove) properties: | . 6.3 Directed graphs, paths, and cycles . A directed graph (digraph) is a way to visualize relations, represented by (V, E) Consists of a set of vertices, V, and a set of directed edges, E, which is a subset of V x V | One element of V is a vertex, and an edge (u, v) connects two vertices, with the tail vertex being represented by u and the head vertex being represented by v | If the head and tail are the same, then the edge is a self-loop | The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing into it (how many times it’s the head) while the out-degree is the number of edges pointing out of it (how many times it’s the tail) | . | A walk in a directed graph is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges that is used to visualize paths between vertices Takes the form of (v0, (v0, v1), v1, (v1, v2), v2, …) | If there are two consecutive vertices, then the edge between those vertices is assumed to exist | The length of a walk is the number of edges | A closed walk is one where the first and last vertices are the same; an open one is one where they are not | . | A trail is an open walk in which no edge occurs more than once | A path is a trail in which no vertex occurs more than once | A circuit is a closed walk in which no edge occurs more than once | A cycle is a circuit of length at least 1 in which no vertex occurs more than once, except the first and last vertices which are the same | . 6.4 Composition of relations . Can combine two relations using a composition, which is denoted S o R A pair (a, c) ∈ S o R if and only if there exists b such that (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ S | Visual representation: | . | . 6.5 Graph powers and the transitive closure . A relation on set can be composed with itself: R o R | A composition of the same relation on set repeated can be represented in power notation R1 = R | Rk = R o Rk-1, for all k &gt;= 2 | . | In an edgeset, Ek is the relation E composed with itself k times, and Gk is the graph whose edgeset is Ek The k is denoted as the power of G | . | The Graph Power Theorem: Let G be a directed graph. Let u and v be any two vertices in G. There is an edge from u to v in Gk if and only if there is a walk of length k from u to v in G. | Visual Example: | The union of Gk represents the reachability of vertices by walks of any positive length in G If the number of vertices is finite, then you need to only add up to the power of |V| | . | A relation R follows the same structure Let R be a relation on a finite domain with n elements; R+ = R1 u R2 u R3 u … u Rn | R+ is known as the transitive closure of R Any relation that contains all pairs from R and is transitive must include all the pairs in R+ | . | Accordingly, G+ is the transitive closure of G | . | Graphical Example: | You can also find a transitive closure using the following method: Repeat until no pairs can be added to R: | If there are three elements x, y, z ∈ A such that (x, y) ∈ R, (y, z) ∈ R and (x, z) ∉ R, then add (x, z) to R | . | . .",

Must look at historical context and literary “sources” (references and analogies) | . | Gualteri does not want to marry because he’d rather live freely, but his vassals want him to marry because if not, he would not have an heir (and thus, no lord) He decides to marry someone who is virtuous | Refers to classism, Griselda is much more virtuous than her class suggests Notice the change of clothes | . | . | Griselda was often on marriage chests (chests that contain things from home to bring to husband’s home), shows that the women should be patient Marriage was considered a “transfer of women”, fathers/brothers giving their daughter/sister to another man | . | Historical context After the plague, there was a renewed focus in art on children to celebrate maternity | Widows kept their dowries but not their children | Marriage and inheritance law supported an indifference towards children, especially illegitimate ones After Boccaccio’s time, the orphanage was created to care for these unwanted children | . | Societal norms was contrived against women and children | The “bride price”, paid by the husband’s family, was replaced by the dowry around 1250 The dowry was the wife’s portion of the inheritance | Florentines didn’t exclusively use the dowry; they also had counter-gifts that the husband gave to the wife | Griselda is re-vested in her new identity/family but can be kicked out at any time | . | . | The story has undertones regarding male anxiety of marriage Fear of taking in a bad wife, displeasing his vassals, obliged to marry | Only marries on his own terms | . | Griselda’s magnanimity is too extreme compared to other stories, as the story is too depressing to be applauded or held up as a model to follow Modern readers dislike this story, but Petrarch loved the story and translated it into Latin, extending the story’s lifespan | . | Spiritual Context May refer to the Book of Job in the Hebrew Bible; Job suffers and bears all of his hardships as a test of God, is given everything back after admitting the power of God | May refer to the Story of Abraham; Abraham was ordered to slaughter his own son and complied to show loyalty, an angel stops him before he does | Griselda can be seen as a Christological figure or martyr Starts out as a sheperd | Father is named Giannucolo (little John) which might refer to John the Baptist, Christ’s cousin who predicted his coming | Griselda is the lamb who must be sacrificed to save her community | Her virtue is similar to the Virgin Mary’s, does everything to please God’s will | . | Pride was the worst of sins (exhibited by Satan, Adam, and Eve) while Humility was the greatest of virtues (exhibited by Christ, Job, Mary, and Griselda) St. Francis was a rich man who gave it up to become a beggar for Christianity; contemporary example of humility during Bocaccio’s time | . | . | Griselda’s tale bookends the Decameron; compare it to Ser Ciappelleto’s story, where he is “the most evil man” while Griselda is “the most virtuous woman” | . | Author’s Conclusion Author believes that he has completely fulfilled what he promised to do | Replies one last time to the critics | Critics state that his stories have gone too far in writing improper things, replies that every story is written in proper language, the stories required certain freedoms, and that the stories were told in a garden instead of a church (secular) | Argues that artists also create pieces regarding such topics | Argues that literature (like wine, weapons, and fire) can be used for good or bad; it is up to the reader to use it | No one is required to read the stories, so you don’t have to interact with them if you don’t want | States that the stories were actually told, questions the fictionality of the stories | Jests about how he does not have an evil tongue; sexual references Is he giving back the lightfulness and playfulness of the Decameron after Griselda’s tale? | . | Builds a defense of the pleasures of the imagination, a parting gift? | Refers to “Galeotto”, a book read in Dante’s Inferno which was romantic in nature and sinful to the characters | . | .",

            "title": "The Costs of Production",
            "content": "Chapter 13: The Costs of Production . 13-1: What Are Costs? . Consider a cookie factory. It must buy ingredients for the cookies, machines to make them, and workers to run the machines. Then, she sells the cookies to customers. . Total revenue, Total Cost, and Profit . Must make the assumption that the goal of a firm is to make profit | Total Revenue: The amount that the firm receives for the sale of its output (cookies) | Total Cost: The amount that the firm pays as input (ingredients, machinery, workers) | Profit: A firm’s total revenue minus its total cost | The objective is to make the profit as high as possible | . Costs as Opportunity Costs . When considering a firm’s cost of production, the opportunity cost must also come into play | Explicit Cost: Any cost that requires a firm to pay out some amount of money | Implicit Cost: Any cost that can’t/isn’t represented by a monetary price If the factory owner can make $100/hr programming, then each hour she spends working on the factory is “losing” $100 | . | Economists will take into account both the implicit and explicit costs while an accountant will only focus on the explicit cost If programming becomes more profitable than running a factory, than the owner might switch professions; the accountant would fail to recognize this change because the factory is still make a profit on paper | . | . The Cost of Capital as an Opportunity Cost . An implicit cost that most businesses incur is the opportunity cost of the capital used to finance the business If the factory cost $300k to buy, then that’s $300k that isn’t accruing interest or being put into the stock market | . | The accountant will fail to account for this implicit cost because there is no money flowing out of the business, but if it was framed as an interest from a loan that you must pay off, then they would | . Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit . Economic Profit = Total Revenue - All Opportunity Costs (implicit or explicit) | Accounting Profit = Total Revenue - All Explicit Costs | Accounting profit is typically larger than economic profit because of the failure to acknowledge implicit costs, but economic profit is more important for firms because it covers all costs | . 13-2: Production and Costs . Assume that the cookie factory cannot change its size but it can change the number of workers it employs (indicative of the short term rather than the long term) . The Production Function . Consider the following table: The relationship between quantity of input and quantity of output is called the production function | . | Marginal product: The change in the quantity of output from one additional unit of input As seen in the table, the more workers you have, the less the marginal product becomes | This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal product | . | Graphical examples: | . From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve . Columns 4, 5, and 6 in the above table all show the cost of producing cookies | The most important relationship in the table is the one between the quantity produced (column 2) and the total cost (column 6) Shown in the above total-cost curve | . | The production function and total-cost curve have relatively inverse relationships; production function gets flatter at higher quantities while total-cost gets steeper | . 13-3: The Various Measures of Cost . Consider a coffee shop with the following data: . Fixed and Variable Costs . The total cost can be divided into two types Fixed costs do not change with the quantity of output produced; includes rent, building costs, etc. | Variable costs do change with the quantity of output produced; includes ingredients, workers, etc. | . | The total cost is the sum of these two costs | . Average and Marginal Cost . When considering costs, two questions may be asked How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee? | How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup? | . | The cost of a typical unit can be found by dividing the total cost by the quantity of output it produces; known as average total cost (ATC) Can also find the average fixed cost (AFC) and the average variable cost (AVC) by dividing the fixed or variable cost by the quantity of output, respectively | . | Average costs are indicative of the cost of a typical unit, but it does not signify by how much the cost will change as the production changes The marginal cost (MC) shows the change in cost when adding 1 unit of output; shown in column 8 | . | Equations to represent the two costs: | . Lecture Notes . In the short term, the total cost is equal to the hourly wage * labor, as the only thing you can do is add more workers | AVC = (Wages * Labor) / Quantity = Wages / (Quantity / Labor) = Wages / Average Product of Labor (APL) AVC and APL are inverse | . | MC = Wages * deltaLabor / deltaQuantity = Wages / (deltaQuantity / deltaLabor) = Wages / Marginal Product Marginal Cost and Marginal Product are inverse | . | . Cost Curves and Their Shapes . The graphs of ATC, AFC, AVC, and MC all follow different shapes: | Rising Marginal Cost The marginal cost rises as the quantity of output increases due to the property of diminishing marginal product; the more he produces, the more it costs to make 1 more unit | . | U-Shaped Average Total Cost The ATC is the sum of the AFC and AVC | At low quantities, it costs a lot to make a few cups of coffee, as the AFC is very high due to being spread out over a few units | The ATC will decrease until adding more units does not lower the AFC, in which case the AVC takes over and begins increasing the ATC | The bottom of the U-Shape that minimizes the ATC is called the efficient scale of the firm; balanced to yield the lowest average total cost | . | The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising. | This makes sense because, if a marginal cost is higher than the ATC, then it will increase the ATC, while if it is lower than the ATC, then it will decrease the ATC | Due to this relationship, the marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its minimum. The ATC cannot lower any further at this point and must increase | . | . | . Typical Cost Curves . This simplified situation showed the property of diminishing marginal product and rising marginal cost, but in real life, this might not always apply | The following graph best represents the cost curves for a typical firm: | Despite the differences, there are three properties that are important to remember: Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output | The average total cost curve is U-shaped | The intersection of the marginal cost and average total cost curves represents the minimum average total cost | . | . 13-4: Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run . The Relationship between Short-Run and Long-Run Average Total Cost . In the short term, a factory owner cannot immediately create a new factory or new facility to increase production Factories are a fixed cost in the short term but a variable cost in the long term | . | In the long run, a company can afford to hire more workers and factories to reduce the average total cost back down | Graph: | . Economies and Diseconomies of Scale . When the average total cost continues to go down as the output increases, then there is an economy of scale | When the average total cost continues to go up as the output increases, then there is an diseconomy of scale | When the average total cost remains constant as output increases, then there are constant returns to scale | Can be explained by specialization When there are few workers and factories, then the average total cost is high | As you add more workers and factories, the cost goes down further because production becomes more efficient | If you add too many workers, then the gains of specialization have already been realized, and you have to hire less efficient workers | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 10: Externalities . Externality: When the actions of one person affects another without paying or receiving compensation If the effect is bad, it is a negative externality, but if it’s good, then it’s a positive externality | Externalities cause the market equiblibrium to become inefficient, especially if buyers and sellers do not take them into account For example, pollution can seriously damage an economy over time, so it’s inefficient to support it | Governments must create laws in order to change the behaviors of those in the market and to dampen the effects of externalities | . | . | . 10-1: Externalities and Market Inefficiency . Welfare Economics: A Recap . The market equilibrium will always adjust to maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus | . Negative Externalities . Suppose the market for steel produces pollution, and for each unit produced, an amount of pollution enters the atmosphere | This externality increases the cost of producing steel as a whole; the social cost equals the cost of pollution to society as a whole plus the cost to the producer | To create a better equilibrium, the entire social cost needs to be taken into account Raising the price of a good (through taxes or otherwise) to better reflect its social cost is called internalizing the externality because it makes buyers and sellers think about the consequences of their decisions | . | . . Positive Externalities . Some activities can bring benefits to third parties, such as education Even if only one person is smarter, society as a whole becomes more intelligent, workers become more specialized, etc. | . | Positive externalities are similar to negative ones in the sense that the total social value of a good may not be realized The government can internalize the externality and incentivize education through subsdizing public schools | . | . . General rule of thumb: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the externality by taxing goods with negative externalities and subsidizing goods with positive externalities. | . 10-2: Public Policies toward Externalities . Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation . Command-and-control policies directly affect consumer behavior Examples include illegalizing the dumping of toxic chemicals into the water supply | . | Most cases of pollution are not as simple, and it is nigh impossible to illegalize all sources of pollution (such as transpotation) | Regulation is difficult and requires much research and deliberation | . Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes and Subsidies . Instead of directly regulating behavior, the government can incentivize their citizens to act a certain way throuh market-based policies For example, they can tax goods with negative externalities and subsidize goods with positive ones | . | Taxes created to deal with negative externalities are called corrective taxes (also called Pigovian taxes) | Corrective taxes are generally preferred to regulations Suppose one market is more effective than another at reducing pollution, and a tax is levied on each unit of pollution produced; the more efficient market is incentivized to reduce pollution by a lot more | The tax places a price on the right to pollute, and it allocates the cost of pollution to factories who produce the most of it | Taxes also provide an incentive to reduce pollution by as much as possible instead of just hitting the required quota | . | Corrective taxes are a much more positive tax than the ones previously discussed | . Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits . Suppose that a regulation of 300 tons of pollution is in place, and a paper and steel mill come to the EPA with a deal The paper mill will reduce its pollution to 200 tons while the steel mill increases its pollution to 400 tons, and the steel mill will play $5 million to the paper mill | This deal creates a new good, pollution permits, and is good for economic efficiency A market to trade permits will emerge, and the right to pollute will be bought by those who value it the most (i.e. those who are unable to efficiently reduce the amount of pollution they produce) | The existence of pollution permits causes the price of pollution to go up; buyers must buy pollution permits, and sellers don’t realize the income from selling a pollution permit if they continue to pollute | . | Both corrective taxes and pollution permits interalize the externality of pollution | . | Graph that shows the effect of both policies: . | In both cases, the EPA determines the price of pollution, either by imposing a price or creating a supply of pollution permits that is perfectly inelastic The choice between corrective taxes and pollution permits boils down to known information If the government knows that the external cost of pollution is $50,000 per unit, then they should tax | If the gogvernment knows how much they want to reduce pollution by, then they should auction off as many pollution permits as would allow the amount to go down | . | . | . Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution . Environmentalists argue that pollution should not be given a fee, as clean water and air are human rights that should not be thought of as monetary | Economists believe that people face trade-offs; clean water and air has a value, but eliminating all pollution is impossible, as it would lead to a lower standard of living A clean environment can be thought of as another good, and it has an income elasticity associated with it as well as a demand/supply curve | . | . 10-3: Private Solutions to Externalities . The Types of Private Solutions . Moral codes and social judgemnts can solve externalities For example, not many people litter because they are taught as children not to | . | Charities can leverage private donations to solve externalities, and schools receive donations/gifts from private parties all the time | Self-interest can internalize the externality Integrating businesses Suppose an apple orchard and bee farm are next to each other; the bees use the apples’ pollen, and the apples are pollinated by the bees, but the two firms don’t plant enough apples/create enough beehives to be completely efficient | Combining the two farms would interalize the externality | . | Creating contracts Creating a contract between the apple grower and beekeepr could specify the number of apple trees/beehives to solve the inefficiency | . | . | . The Coase Theorem . The Coase theorem stipulates that, if private parties can bargain over the allocation of resources, then they can always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently | Suppose that Emily has a dog that barks and disturbs her neighbor, Horace If Horace offers Emily money to get rid of the dog, then they can accurately determine the value of having the dog/getting rid of the dog for each person | If Emily values the dog more than Horace’s offer, then the allocation is efficient; if Horace offers enough money for Emily to get rid of the dog, then the allocation is efficient | . | Suppose that Horace has the legal right to peace and quiet Coase theorem states that the distribution of rights does not matter | Horace can legally compel Emily to get rid of the dog, but Emily can provide a counteroffer of money for Horace to not pursue legal action | The situation is the same; if Emily offers enough money, then Horace won’t get rid of the dog, but if she doesn’t, he will, leaqding to an efficient allocation of resources | . | The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome is efficient. | . Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work . Private parties often fail to resolve the problems of externalities | Transaction costs, or costs that parties incur while bargaining, can hamper the ability to solve an externality problem Suppose that Emily and Horace spoke different languages; the cost of hiring translators might outweigh the value of solving the problem which could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources | . | Bargaining offers can also break down If Horace offers a price below his value to remove the dog and Emily counteroffers a price above her value to keep it, then negotiations could fail | . | Efficient bargains become increasingly difficult when the number of involved parties is large If a factory pollutes a fishing lake, it could be difficult to get all of the local fishermen to make a deal with the factory | . | . Chapter 11: Public Goods and Common Resources . 11-1: The Different Kinds of Goods . There are different kinds of goods; a market for ice cream is easy to make efficient, but a market for clean air is not | Two different characteristics of goods Excludability: How easy it is to prevent someone from using a good; if you can’t prevent someone from using it, then it’s not excludable | Rivalry in consumption: If one person’s use of a good reduces another person’s ability to use it, then it is a rival in consumption (similar to a zero sum game) | . | These two characteristics creates four categories Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption, makes up most of the goods in the economy: you must pay for it to use it, and if you use it, someone else can’t | Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in competition, makes up goods/services that are provided by the government or nature | Common resources are rival in competition but not excludable, makes up goods that anyone has access to | Club goods are excludable but not rival in competition, makes up services that you must pay to use | Table of categories: | The categories can blur based on factors such as population or government control, but they are useful for making generalizations | . | . 11-2: Public Goods . For this section, consider a fireworks display, which is neither excludable nor rival in competition | . The Free-Rider Problem . Say that a town with 500 residents place a 10$ value on watching the fireworks on the 4th of July If the fireworks cost the government $1000, then there is a total surplus of $4000 if there is no fee | The citizens are free riders; they receive the benefit without paying for it | . | A private market would not work, as the citizens of the town would not purchase a ticket to watch fireworks that they could watch for free This results in a market failure | The market failure arises because of an externality; if a private firm put on a firework show, then there are people who can watch it without paying for it, thus causing a third party to gain a benefit without paying Causes economic inefficiency | . | . | The issue can be resolved by levying a tax and then the government using the revenue from said tax to pay a private firm to put on the fireworks | Because public goods are not excludable, the free-rider problem prevents an efficient, private market for them from arising | . Some Important Public Goods . National Defense No one can be excluded from defense after it is set up, and the defense of one person doesn’t detract from the defense of another; neither excludable nor rival in competition | Extremely expensive to provide | . | Basic Research Complicated and specific research can be patented and therefore excluded, but general knowledge cannot; once a theorem is proven, anyone can use it without restricting others’ access to it | Firms spend money on specific research in order to make money, but they do not spend resources on basic research Public policy (in the form of patents) is therefore required in order to incentivize research | Basic research is subsidized as well | . | . | Fighting Poverty The government helps the poor in order to provide equality; doesn’t exclude their services and they try to help as many people as possible | Cannot create a private market for fighting poverty because of the free market problem | . | . The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis . The government must choose which public goods to provide and in how much quantity Must use a cost-benefit analysis in order to determine which goods to provide | Difficult to determine the true value provided by a public good because there is no “price tag” on it; must use approximations | . | . 11-3: Common Resources . The fact that common resources are rival in competition gives way to the Tragedy of the Commons | . The Tragedy of the Commons . Suppose there is a grass field that a medieval town shares to graze sheep When there few sheperds, everyone can use the grass field, but after the population grows, the grass field becomes barren and doesn’t regrow | The reason for the destruction is because social and private incentives don’t mesh; sheperds want to use the field as much as possible, but it’s better for the community if they use it more sparingly | . | The Tragedy of the Commons arises when a common resource is overused and its quality deteriorates as a result | Common resources are often used excessively (because no one wants to be the one who is at a disadvantage for not using it), and the government must regulate or tax it in order to regulate consumption | . Some Important Common Resources . Clean Air and Water Pollution can negatively affect clean air and water because firms take it for granted, and overfishing can also ruin clear water | . | Congested Roads Once a road is congested, its use negatively affects other people’s use of it - it becomes a common resource | One way to prevent road congestion is to add a tax or toll and raise the toll during rush hours | Another way is to add a tax to gasoline which will prevent as many people from driving Not preferred because it can have other effects; it also disincentivizes driving in general | . | . | Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife Many animals are common resources, and most people have little incentive to keep the population up, so overfishing and whaling is a possible issue | Oceans are one of the least regulated common resources, as many countries have access to it and it’s difficult to enforce an agreement | Within nations, governments can more regulate fishing such as through the use of hunting/fishing licenses | . | .",

Challenge Activity is good to practice onto vs. one-to-one . 4.4: The inverse of a function . The inverse of a function is found by reversing the order of its tuples; that is, f-1 = { (y, x) : (x, y) ∈ f }.

            "content": "Chapter 8: Application: The Costs of Taxation . 8-1: The Deadweight Loss of Taxation . How a Tax Affects Market Participants . Recall that the benefit received by buyers is the consumer surplus and the benefit received by sellers is the producer surplus | The tax revenue that the government receives is the size of the tax times the quantity of a good; T x Q Graph: | . | The following graph and bullets represent what taxes do to an economy’s well-being: | Welfare without a Tax The total surplus in a market is reprsented by the entirety of the triangle up to the equilibrium point, as the government isn’t driving a tax wedge into it | . | Welfare with a Tax With the tax, both the consumer and producer surplus is stifled; they only receive a surplus of sizing of triangles A and F, respectively | . | Changes in Welfare After the tax, both consumers and producers are left worse off while the government is better for it | The drop in total surplus is called the deadweightloss and is represented by the area of C + E | . | . Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade . Scenario of how taxes cause deadweight losses: Imagine a cleaner, Malik, and a homeowner, Mei Mei’s value of cleaning the house is $120, and Malik’s cost is $80, so a fair pricing would be $100 (surplus of $40) | If the government levies a $50 tax, there is no good pricing for Malik and Mei If Mei pays $120, then Malik only receives $70 | If Malik charges $80, then Mei pays $130 | . | Business is called off, thus resulting in a deadweight loss | . | Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade. | The graph from before represents the deadweight loss, as those closer to the equilibrium point are closer to the margin and will thus stop doing business if it stops being lucrative | . 8-2: The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss . When the supply/demand is elastic, then the size of the deadweight loss increases drastically, as more buyers/sellers are willing/able to exit the market | Visual Representation: | General rule: the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the larger the deadweight loss of a tax. | . 8-3: Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary . The size of the tax can change the deadweight loss and tax revenue | If the tax is too small, then the government might not realize enough revenue, but if the tax is too large, then it may shrink the market can cause the government (and market) to fail | Graphics: | The size of the deadweight loss is exponential compared to the size of the tax If a tax doubles, then the width and height of the deadweight loss doubles, thus making it increase by a factor of 4 | . | . Lecture Notes . A subsidy actually hurts the total surplus of an economy, as pushing the quantity past its equilibrium leads to a loss in surplus | . Chapter 9: Application: International Trade . 9-1: The Determinants of Trade . The Equilibrium without Trade . Scenario: Imagine a country named Isoland with a textile market that is isolated from the rest of the world Because they are isolated, the textile market consists only of Isolandian buyers and sellers | Graph: | . | A new president is elected and advocates for free trade, asks three questions: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the domestic textile market? | Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the gains exceed the losses? | Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy | | . The World Price and Comparative Advantage . First question that must be asked is whether or not Isoland will be a textile exporter or importer | Economists must compare the current Isolandian price of textiles to other prices of textiles; the current, prevailing price worldwide is called the world price If the world price is greater than the domestic price, then Isoland will become an exporter (producer); if it is lower, then Isoland will become an importer (consumer) | Shows if Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles, thus clarifying what Isoland should specialize in | . | . 9-2: The Winners and Losers from Trade . Must begin with the assumption that Isoland is a small economy and that its actions will have a negligible effect on the world markets; specifically, Isoland will not affect the world price of textiles Economies that cannot affect the price are called price takers; they take the world price | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an exporting country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles rises to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity suppplied is higher than the domestic quantity demanded, but that’s ok because the surplus is sold off as export | Though quantities differ, the world market as a participant keeps the domestic market in equilibrium The horziontal line for world price represents the completely elastic world demand for textiles | . | There are pros and cons; the domestic price increases, so domestic producers are better off while domestic consumers are not The total surplus increases at the cost of consumer surplus; sellers beenfit much more in an exporting country than consumers | . | Two conclusions can be made: When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good are worse off. | Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an importing country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles lowers to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity demanded is higher than the domestic quantity suppplied, but that’s ok because the shortage is bought as import | The supply curve is elastic because Isoland can buy as much of the good as they want at the world price | . The Effects of a Tariff . Tariff: A tax on imported goods from other countries A tariff does not apply to an exporting country because no one would import goods | . | Graph that shows the effect of a tariff: Area D represents the loss from the overproduction of textiles, while area F represents the loss from the underconsumption of textiles Tariff incentivizes marginal sellers to produce at a profit because the tariff raises the price | Tariff deincentivizes marginal buyers to purchase because the tariff raises the price | . | . | After the tariff, the price of the good rises to the equilibrium price before opening up to international trade Domestic sellers are better off (sell at a higher price), domestic buyers are worse off (buy at a higher price), and the government gains rvenue | . | There is a deadweight loss, but it does not amount to the increase in surplus compared to a purely domestic market | . Other Benefits of International Trade . Increased variety of goods: Different goods can only be produced in different countries | Lower costs through economies of scale: Some goods have lower costs of production if created in bulk; having specialized countries allows for a more efficient allocation of resources | Increased competition: Less likelihood of overwhelming market power because the market is bigger | Increased productivity: Only the most productive firms survive and thrive, thus increasing productivity | Enhanced flow of ideas: Import of advanced technologies can help developing countries develop faster | . 9-3: The Arguments for Restricting Trade . The Jobs Argument . Importing goods could destroy domestic firms and cause a lack of jobs Quite the opposite; new jobs open up as a result of trade (merchants, ambassadors, etc.) | Workers in inefficient industries move to advantageous ones | . | Isoland will always have a comparative advantage in some good, so there will always be jobs | . The National-Security Argument . If a domestic market for defense is non-existent (i.e. gun industry, or steel industry to make weaponry), then if war breaks out, the country will be vulnerable due to its dependencies on other countries Argument is legitimate but may be used too liberally; companies who wish to protect their own interests may push the argument extremely fast and exaggerate their roles in national security | . | Some may see a lower steel price as a way to stockpile weaponry at a lower cost | . The Infant-Industry Argument . New industries might ask for protection from foreign industries in order to get off the ground and become competitive Old industries might ask the same in order to adjust to new conditions | Hard to implement and determine effectiveness; must determine which industries will become profitable and if that protection is worth it Picking such industries is difficult, and protections may be more permanent than temporary due to lobbying | . | . | Argument is flawed; if an industry is projected to be profitable, then owners would take a loss in the short term in order to gain in the long run | . The Unfair-Competition Argument . Different laws in different countries can make it hard for some countries to compete If one country provides subsidies or allows for child labor, then they will have an advantage | . | Lower price is not a bad thing; it just means that the country is not competitive in that industry alone and can instead focus on other industries If foreign industries are subsidized, then there is a lower cost of good and no waste of taxpayer dollars | . | . The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument . Governments can threaten and use tariffs as a way to remove other tariffss and lead to freer trade If the threat doesn’t work, then imposing the tariff would hurt the economic welfare of a country, and if a country doesn’t follow through with its tariff, then it loses its standing and reputation | . | . Lecture Notes . Ricardian Trade Model: Gains in trade are due to differences in opportunity costs (AKA comparative advantage) | Quota: A limit on the quantity of imports Same effect as a tariff, but there is no tax revenue, so the decrease in total surplus is even greater | . | Collective Protection Problem Few producers vs. many consumers, easier to organize | . | .",

Welfare Economics: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being Answers questions about how to best organize economic activity | . | . 7-1: Consumer Surplus . Willingness to pay . Willingness to pay: The maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good; represents what a buyer values a good at | Consider the following scenario where four people want to buy an album: | . Buyer Willingness to Pay . Taylor | 100 | . Carrie | 80 | . Rihanna | 70 | . Gaga | 50 | . In an auction, the price would raise to 80$, and Taylor would buy it at 80$ or more (because Carrie is unwilling to pay more) Taylor’s consumer surplus is her willingness to pay minus the price she paid | If there are two albums to sell, then both Taylor and Carrie receive a consumer surplus, and the total market consumer surplus rises | . | . Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus . Can use the demand schedule shown above to create a demand curve Price is represented by the marginal buyer, or the buyer that would leave if the price was raised | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the album drops according to each buyer’s willingness to pay | The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | Demand curve represents maximum willingness to pay | . How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus . At lower prices, the price of the good is lower than more consumers’ value of the good, thus leading to a higher consumer surpus | Graph: | . What Does Consumer Surplus Measure? . Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being from the perspective of the buyers, as they are getting good value | Consumer surplus can sometimes be ignored in a market; lowering the price of heroine is not good but would increase consumer surplus | . 7-2: Producer Surplus . Cost and the Willingness to Sell . Cost: The value of everything (resources, manpower, time) that a seller uses to produce a good, essentially equivalent to willingness to sell | Consider the following scenario where four sellers are competing to paint a house: | . Seller Cost . Vincent | 900 | . Claude | 800 | . Pablo | 600 | . Andy | 500 | . In an auction, the price would start high and quickly lower to 500$; Andy would offer a price of 600$ or slightly lower and take the job (because Pablo is unwilling to sell for lower than 600$) Andy’s consumer surplus is the price he sells his service at minus his cost of production | If there are two houses to paint, then Pablo and Andy will both receive a producer surplus, and the total market producer surplus rises | . | . Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus . Can use the supply schedule shown above to create a supply curve Price is represented by the marginal seller, or the seller that would leave if the price was lowered | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the service raises according to each seller’s cost | The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | . How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus . A higher price increases producer surplus because more producers get a higher profit margin for their service | Graph: | . 7-3: Market Efficiency . The Benevolent Social Planner . Consider a dictator who wants to maximize economic well-being in society | Can calculate total surplus in a market by adding consumer and producer surplus Total surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers = Buyers’ willingness to pay - Sellers’ cost | . | An allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus exhibits **efficiency** Inefficient allocations include ones where producers are, wastefully, having higher costs to produce or ones where goods aren’t consumed by buyers who value them the most | . | Equality: Whether buyers and sellers both have similar levels of economics well-being | Thinking of the market as a pie, efficiency attempts to make the pie as big as possible while equality attempts to split it evenly | . Evaluating the Market Equilibrium . At the equilibrium, the buyers who value the good the most and the sellers who have the lowest cost both consume/produce the good; therefore, the market equilibrium represents the greatest total surplus Graph: | . | Free markets also naturally produce the quantity of goods which maximize total surplus; reducing the quantity creates a shortage, while increasing the quantity creates a surplus Graph: | . | The benevolent dictator need not intervene; the invisible hand of the market will do everything for them | .",

            "content": "1.12: Rules of inference with propositions . There are rules of inference that can be generally applied to arguments to know if they are valid List of rules: | . | Proving the validity of an argument using the rules of inference and laws of propositions is called a logical proof Each step has different justifications; providing a hypothesis is calleda “hypothesis”, and you must state the law/rule if not | Example of a logical proof: | . | . STUDY THIS SECTION, Challenge Activity 1.12.1 part 4 is good . 1.13: Rules of inference with quantifiers . To apply a rule of inference to a quantified statement, you must use an element in the domain of the statement Elements can be defined in the hypotheses, example below: | Can use one of two elements in a logical proof Arbitrary elements have no special properties other than the fact that they are in the domain | Particular elements can have properties that aren’t shared by others in the domain | . | An element defined in a hypothesis is particular by default and must be labeled as “Hypothesis”, while an element defined in the proof is labeled “Element definition” | . | Table of rules of inference for quantified statements: . | A common error is defining the same variable for two different instances of existential instantiation; make sure to mark one variable as C and one as D | . STUDY THIS SECTION, Challenge Activity is good . 2.1: Mathematical definitions . Even integers can be written as 2k; odd ones are written as 2k + 1 (also known as parity) | Same parity is if two numbers are both odd or even; if not, they are of opposite parity | Rational numbers are ones where there exists integers x, where y!= 0 and r = x/y | A number (x) that divides another number (y) is one where y % x == 0 Denoted as x|y (x divides y); x is a multiple of y if it divides it | Numbers that don’t divide are denoted as so: | A number that divides another is called a multiple | . | Prime numbers and composite numbers (if you don’t know this shit ur dumb) | Inequalities: &lt;, &gt;, =, etc. | . 2.2: Introduction to proofs . Theorem: A statement that can be proven to be true via a proof Proofs might use axioms which are statements assumed to be true | . | Theorems are often rewritten as universally or existentially quantified statements | Proof of exhaustion: A proof that is done by examining every element in a domain | Proofs involving universal generalizations uses a statement to define an arbitrary element | Counterexample: definition of one element in a domain that makes the statement false | Existence proofs show that existential statements are true Constructive proofs of existence are the most common, and they provide a specific example in the domain that satisfies the statement | Nonconstructive proofs of existence provide an example with certain properties that satisfies the statement | Disproving existential statements requies DeMorgan’s Law and a proof that a negated statement is true Example: | . | . | . 2.3: Best practices and common errors in proofs . Section includes various important factoids to know . . . . 2.4: Writing direct proofs . Direct proofs: A hypothesis, p, is assumed to be true and the conclusion, c, is proven due to that assumption (p -&gt; c) | . 2.5: Proof by contrapositive . Proof by contrapositive: A proof of a conditional theorem of the form (p -&gt; c) by proving (!c -&gt; !p) Example of what to do with multiple hypotheses: | . | . 2.6: Proof by contradiction .

            "content": "Chapter 5: Elasticity and Its Application . 5-1: The Elasticity of Demand . Elasticity: A measure of a good’s quantity supplied/demanded in response to a change in price | . The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of demand: how much the quantity demanded changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in demand in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Factors of price elasticity of demand Availability of Close Substitutes: Goods with substitutes are elastic while those without are not | Necessities vs. Luxuries: Necessities are inelastic (demand will always remain the same) while luxuries are elastic | Definition of the Market: Items in a broad market (food industry) are more inelastic due to the lack of close substitutes, while items in a narrow market (vanilla ice cream) are elastic | Time Horizon: Good become more elastic with time; short term changes may be small, but long term ones are bigger | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand . Formula for price elasticity of demand is defined as: A note about the formule; the change in quantity demanded is negative, while the change in price is positive. Economists use the absolute value to make it easier | . | . The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities . If you use the above formula to calculate elasticity, then the elasticity from Point A to Point B may be different than Point B to Point A | Midpoint formula is better suited: Doesn’t change based on direction | . | Concept is more important than calculation for this book | . The Variety of Demand Curves . Demand is elastic when elasticity is greater than one and inelastic if not When the elasticity is equal to one, the demand is at unit elasticity | Rule of thumb for demand curves: slope is close to 0 = demand is elastic, slope is close to infinity = demand is inelastic | . . | . Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand . Total revenue: Price of a good * Quantity of good sold Graphical representation: | . | Total revenue is affected by elasticity An increase in price of an inelastic good increases revenue while an increase in price of an inelastic good decreases revenue | A unit elastic good will not experience a change in total revenue if the price changes | . | . Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve . Despite having a constant slope, a linear demand curve can have varying elasticities due to differences in percent change At high prices with low quantities, the curve is elastic, while at low prices with high quantities, the curve is inelastic | Graph and table: | Total revenue changes based on elasticities as well | . | . Other Demand Elasticities . The income elasticity of demand is the measure of how quantity demanded changes based on changes in income Formula: | Normal goods have positive income elasticities while inferior goods have negative ones | Engel’s Law stipulates: As a family’s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one. By contrast, luxuries such as jewelry and recreational goods tend to have large income elasticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their incomes are too low. | In other words, if an item makes up a small part of your income, the item is more inelastic because you can afford to pay the difference in price | . | The cross-price elasticity of demand is the measure of how the quantity demanded changes based on price changes of another good Formula: | Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities while complement goods have negative ones | . | . 5-2: The Elasticity of Supply . The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of supply: how much the quantity supplied changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in supply in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Elasticity depends on how easy it is for sellers to change the quantity supplied Beachfront land is inelastic (cannot create more) but manufactured goods are elastic | . | Key determinant of price elasticity of supply is time period Supply is more elastic in the long run vs. short run, as firms cannot change the size of factories easily in a short period of time | Other changes, such as closing and opening, make products more elastic | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply . Formula for price elasticity of supply is defined as: | . The Variety of Supply Curves . On a graph, a slope closer to infinity is inelastic while a slope closer to 0 is elastic | . . 5-3: Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity . Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers? . Scenario: you are a wehat farmer who spends time making your land as productive as possible | New strand of wheat is found that increases wheat production by 20% | Because wheat (food) is an inelastic good, the total revenue falls when the quantity sold increases Farmers lose money, but they must use the new strand in order to remain competitive with other farmers | . | Affect of advancements in farming can be seen in the vast decrease in workers in the farm industry | Negative effect on farmers still has a positive effect on society; food is cheaper, more workers to do other things | . Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High? . Scenario: OPEC raised the price of oil to increase income From 1973 to 1974, oil prices raised 50%, and they continued to rise | . | OPEC was unable to maintain a high price of oil, and it went back down to low prices during the 90s | Can be explained by elasticities Oil is inelastic, and short term prices rose because people needed to buy oil | In the long term, non-OPEC countries found different ways to produce oil and oil consumption was made more efficient | . | Short term cuts to supply can lead to short term gains but will lose money in the long run | . . Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime? . Scenario: drug use is a serious problem, and the government tries to reduce the amount of drugs in the country | A raise in law enforcement for drugs reduces the quantity supplied for drugs Raises the price of drugs and reduces the quantity demanded for drugs | . | Demand for drugs remains inelastic (drug users will continue to want drugs), so drug users must pay more money for drugs which leads to crimes in order to obtain said money | Reducing demand for drugs can be more beneficial, as it will reduce both the price and quantity of drugs | Some argue that enforcing drug laws could be more beneficial to stopping drug crimes in the long run than in the short run, as goods become more elastic over time | . . Chapter 6: Supply, Demand, and Government Policies . 6-1: Controls on Prices . Different groups may want the equilibrium price of a good to go up or down based on their interests, and will lobby legislators to change the price Legislators can create a price ceiling (price maximum, favored by buyers) or price floor (price minimum, favored by suppliers) to make it so that the price can’t go beyond a certain range | . | . How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes . A price ceiling above the equilibrium price is not binding and has no effect on the price or quantity of ice cream | A price ceiling below the equilibrium price is a binding constraint and affects the good Leads to a shortage because there is too much demand but not enough supply | Due to the shortage of the good, sellers must ration their supply to buyers Includes imposing long lines or selling to favored groups (family, friends, racial/ethnic groups, etc.) | . | General rule: When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buyers | Binding constraints are undesirable because discrimination by seller bias is both inefficient and unfair | . | . . How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes . Binding price floors create a surplus of supply because the demand is too low for the supply Surplus of supply leads to further biases on the buyers’ side “Rationing” from buyers could include buying from sellers who are friends, family, of a certain race, etc. | . | . | Example: Increasing the minimum wage increases the supply of labor but decreases the demand for it, leading to more unemployment | . . Evaluating Price Controls . Economists dislike price controls because free markets tend to be the best way to organize economic activity Prices are the evolution of millions of decisions and settle at optimal values | . | The government can help to improve an economy, but setting price controls might hurt a group that they want to help A suggestion is to pay rent subsidies rather than create price controls | . | . 6-2: Taxes . Tax incidence: How taxes are distributed throughout a market | . How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers for each sale of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on sellers, the supply curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the input price is higher, the supply curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts upward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The supply curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The tax makes buyers worse off because they have to pay more for ice cream | The tax makes sellers worse off because, despite the increase in price, they lose 50 cents every sale | . | Taxes discourage market activity, decreasing the quantity sold of a good | Buyers and sellers both share the burden of taxes | Graph: | . How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers on each purchase of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the price is higher, the demand curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts downward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The demand curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up (after adding the 50 cent tax) and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The effect of a tax on buyers and sellers are the same; the sellers sell for $2.80 and the buyers buy for $3.30, thus reducing the market for ice cream | 50 cents always goes to the government which is the reason for the similarity | . | Graph: | . Elasticity and Tax Incidence . Depending on elasticity, the tax incidence can vary greatly | Graph: | The more inelastic of supply/demand is the one who has the heavier tax burden (“A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic”) This is due to the ability/willingness of buyers/sellers to change the quantity demanded/supplied of a good | . | .",

The Republic at a glance . Plato described as a revolutionary, conservative, fascist, communist, practical reformer, and dreamer due to the book | Main idea is to show that one who is just is the best kind of person | Plato wants the reader to think about his ideas instead of taking them at face value | Does Plato believe that philosophers can be rulers? How realistic are his proposals about education meant to be? What is the point of the rulers’ theroretical knowledge, and how is it to be applied in practice? | Plato treads the line between practicality and theory; doesn’t want a theory to be bastardized, but also doesn’t support a theory which is impractical | .

Why did Plato come up with the Forms . Wanted to find a solution to the political corruption of his day | A good person who can understand the world is spiritually ascending | Wants to expand the realm of philosophy; philosophers are just, and forms are necessary to understand the world | The Forms are a basis of a good person’s understanding | Wants his citizens to search for the truth by understanding the Forms | . The Sun and the Line: 2 analogies for the Platonic good . The Sun The sun provides light and growth in the physical world, allows us to see particulars | The good provides reality and truth to the intelligible world, allows us to know the Forms | The sun in the physical realm is like the good in the intelligible realm | The good makes it possible for objects of knowledge to be known by the mind, like the sun provides light | The good is the highest Form of knowledge | . | The Divided Line Lower half: physical reality illuminated by the sun 2 types of particulars Shadows, images, copies are linked to imagination, dreams, and fantasies | Physical objects are linked to beliefs | . | . | Upper half: intelligible reality illuminated by the Good 2 types of objects of knowledge Mathematics, science are linked ot understanding and reasoning | Forms are linked to rational intuition and intellection | . | . | Hard to cross the line from physical to intelligible reality | Lessons Separates lower and upper line | Getting from one point to another represents cognitive improvement | Emphasizes knowing things directly instead of indirectly (in images, shadows, etc.) | Mathematics is crucial in moving from the perceived world to the abstract | . | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand . 4-1: Markets and Competition . What is a Market? . Market: The buyers and sellers of a good or service Buyers determine demand, sellers determine demand | Markets can be organized or disorganized Crop market is organized; sellers meet together and determine how much supply there is while buyers gather and auction for goods | Smaller, local markets (say, ice cream) are unorganized; ice cream stores are not in contact with each other and buyers don’t meet | . | . | . What is Competition? . Prices are determined by the entire market, as everyone is competing with each other | Competitive Market: A market with enough participants (buyers and sellers) that no one individual has a significant impact on the market For this chapter, markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive; all sold goods are exactly the same, and there are enough buyers and sellers that no one can influence the market heavily | Buyers and sellers are price takers; they can buy and sell as much as they want but only at the market price | Easy entry and exit from the industry in the long-run | . | Many markets are (nearly) perfectly competitive, but some have only one seller, leading to a monopoly | . 4-2: Demand . The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded . Quantity Demanded: The amount of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to purchase Many factors can affect quantity demanded, but the assumed, simplified market will focus on one: price | Law of Demand: Considering everything else equal, price and demand are inverse; when price rises, demand lowers, and vice versa | Graphical representation: | Above table is an example of a demand schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded | The graph shown is known as the demand curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded; typically slopes downwards | . | . Market Demand versus Individual Demand . Market Demand is the sum of all of the individual demands for a good or service Example of creating a market demand curve from two individual demand curves: | . | . Shifts in the Demand Curve . Income Lower income means that a demand curve falls, as there is less money to spend | Normal good: A good whose demand falls when income falls | Inferior good: A good whose demand increases when income falls (such as public transportation) | . | Prices of Related Goods Substitutes: Two or more goods that are similar enough to be affected by each otehrs prices If the cost of ice cream goes down, then the demand for frozen yogurt goes down too (because froyo is more expensive and fairly similar) | . | Complements: Two or more goods that will go up or down in demand together depending on their prices If the price of tapioca pearls lowers, then the demand for both pearls and tea will increase | . | . | Tastes Depending on your tastes, you may buy more or less of a good/service; hard to explain and unscientific | . | Expectations What you expect to happen can affect your behavior; if you think a disaster will occur, you’re more willing to buy more survival goods and less willing to buy unnecessary goods | . | Number of Buyers Adding buyers increases demand and lowering buyers decreases demand | . | . Additional Notes . The relationship between demand and quantity demanded is negative for two reasons Substitution effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers substitute it by buying similar products instead | Income effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers’ purchasing power goes down, and the consumer buys less of the good but more of other goods | . | Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: The idea that each additional unit of a good that you receive becomes lower in value (or utility) as you receive more Indifference Curve: A curve showing the relationship between two goods that a consumer needs/likes; takes the shape of 1/x and is convex | . | . 4-3: Supply . The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied . Quantity Supplied: The amount of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell A big determinant is price; when price of ice cream is high, the quantity supplied increases (because sellers want to make a higher profit) and vice versa | Law of Supply: Considering everything else equal, price and supply are related; when price rises, supply increases, and vice versa | Graphical Representation: | Above table is an example of a supply schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied | The graph shown is known as the supply curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity supply; typically slopes upwards | . | . Market Supply versus Individual Supply . Market supply is the sum of all individual supplies | . Shifts in the Supply Curve . Input Prices The price of the inputs to make a good/service (ingredients, machinery, manpower) affects the quantity supplied | Increase in input price lowers quantity supplied and vice versa | . | Technology Advancements in technology increases the quantity supplied because it becomes cheaper/faster to produce | . | Expectations A firm that expects the popularity of a good/service to rise may produce more of it, and vice versa | If the price is expected to decrease, firms will supply more | . | Number of sellers More sellers = more quantity supplied, and vice versa | . | . 4-4: Supply and Demand Together . Equilibrium . When a supply curve and demand curve are graphed together, there is a singular point of interception That point is called the equilibrium, with the price representing the equilibrium price and the quantity representing the equilibrium quantity | Equilibrium point is in perfect balance; the quantity and price is the same that the buyers demand and the sellers supply | . | Naturally, prices and quantity move towards the equilibrium point If there is too much supply compared to demand, then there is a surplus and sellers cannot sell their goods at the current price Sellers have too much supply; begin to cut prices, thus increasing demand, lowering prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | If there is too much demand compared to supply, then there is a shortage and buyers cannot buy the goods they want due to a lack of availability Sellers are enabled to raise prices, thus lowering demand, increasing prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | . | . . Theory of equilibrium leads to Law of Supply and Demand: the price of a good naturally adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance | . Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium . Must analyze events which affect equilibriums with three steps Does it change the supply curve, demand curve, or both? | Does it shift the curve to the left or right? | Compare the supply-and-demand diagrams to see how the shift affected the equilibrium point | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand One summer, it is more hot than usual Hot weather increases demand for ice cream but does not change supply curve | More demand shifts the demand curve to the right | Demand curve now meets the supply curve at a higher price and quantity | . | . | Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves In the last example, the actual supply curve didn’t move; instead, the equilibrium point moved upwards along the curve | A shift in the supply/demand curve is called a “change” while a movement along the supply/demand curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied/demanded” | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply One summer, a hurricane destroys a sugarcane crop, increasing the price of sugar Raise in input costs leads to a reduction in the amount of ice cream produced | Less supply shifts the supply curve to the left | There is now a shortage of ice cream, and the equilibrium point moves left along the demand curve | . | . | Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand Let’s say that the hot weather and hurricane occurred in the same summer Both curves shift; the demand increases because of the heat, and the supply decreases because of a higher input cost | Demand curve shifts to the right, and supply curve shifts to the left | Depending on the size of the shifts, there are two possible outcomes, but both result in an increase in equilibrium price | . | . | . . Discussion Notes: Price typically falls on the y axis, and quantity falls on the x axis | Total revenue (p x q) follows a parabolic shape (goes up, plateaus, then goes down) | Elasticity: The change in price divided by the change in quantity; %deltaQ/%deltaP Typically calculated using derivatives, but can use a midpoint formula ∣Q2−Q1(Q1+Q2)/2P2−P1(P1+P2)/2∣| { {Q_2 - Q_1 over (Q_1 + Q_2) / 2} over {P_2 - P_1 over (P_1 + P_2) / 2} } |∣(P1​+P2​)/2P2​−P1​​(Q1​+Q2​)/2Q2​−Q1​​​∣ | . | Unit elastic is when your elasticity is equal to 1; over 1 is elastic, and under 1 is inelastic | Goods with substitutes are usually elastic, while necessities are inelastic | Decrease in price of an elastic good will increase revenue, while a decrease in price of an inelastic good will decrease revenue | . | . | Lecture Notes: Supply curves should start above (0, 0) because companies need to cover fixed costs | Regular equations for curves start with Q (Q = mP + b), but if P is on the left, then it is called inverse demand/supply | . | .",

            "content": "1.6: Predicates and quantifiers . Predicate: A statement whose truth value depends on one or more variables, even if the outcome is predetermined Represented as a function; “P of x” | Ex: “x is an even number” would be true if x = 4, but not if x = 5 | Domain: All of the possible values of x for a predicate “x is an even number” would have a domain of all natural numbers | If not apparent from context, should be defined in the predicate | . | Predicates do not have to be strictly mathematical; general statements can be turned into predicates as well | . | Universal quantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∀ which reads as “for all” ∀x P(x) reads as “for every x, P(x)” and is a proposition that only returns true if every x in the domain is true ∀x P(x) is a universally quantified statement | . | Proof showing that a universally quantified statement is true: . | Counterexample: An element in the domain of a universally quantified statement that is false; used to prove that a statement is false | . | Existensial equantifier: A way to turn a predicate into a proposition; denoted by ∃ which reads as “there exists” ∃x P(x) reads as “there exists an x, such that P(x)” and is a proposition that returns true if any x in the domain is true ∃x P(x) is an existentially quantified statement | . | Example: An element in the domain of a existentially quantified statement that is true; used to prove that a statement is true | Proof showing that an existentially quantified statement is false: | . | . . 1.7: Quantified statements . Can combine quantifiers and logical expressions to create quantified statements Example: Let P(x) = x is prime and O(x) = x is odd; ∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬O(x)) states that there exists a positive number that is prime and not odd | . | A free variable is defined as a variable that can be any value in the domain, while a bound variable is defined as a variable that is bound to a quantifier x in P(x) is a free variable, while x in ∃x P(x) is a bound variable | A statement is a proposition if it contains no free variables | . | Can express quantified statements in English Let P(x) = x came to the party and S(x) = x was sick | ∃x (S(x) ∨ P(x)) is true because Joe satisfies the proposition: S(Joe) ∨ P(Joe) == True | . | . Name S(x) P(x) . Joe | F | T | . Theodore | T | F | . Gertrude | F | T | . Samuel | F | F | . If there are no values in the domain/set, then a universally quantified statement is vacuously true and a existentially quantified statement is false | . . 1.8: De Morgan’s law for quantified statements . ¬∀x F(x) can be rewritten as ∃x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∀x F(x) ≡ ∃x ¬F(x) Ex: “Not every bird can fly” == “There exists a bird that cannot fly” | . | Likewise, ¬∃x F(x) can be rewritten as ∀x ¬F(x); AKA ¬∃x F(x) ≡ ∀x ¬F(x) Ex: “There does not exist a bird that can fly” == “Every bird cannot fly” | . | When simplifying a quantifier, make sure to use a double negation on it Example: | . | . . 1.9: Nested quantifiers . When there are multiple variables in a predicate, you must use multiple, nested quantifiers Examples of nested quantifiers: | . | Propositions with multiple variables can be thought of as pairs Take ∀x ∀y M(x, y); this proposition is false if there is ANY pair of x, y that does not satisfy M(x, y) (including if x and y are the same) | For ∃x ∃y M(x, y), the proposition is false if ALL pairs of x, y are not true for M(x, y) (also including if x and y are the same) | . | If a quantified statement has two quantifiers (one existential (∃) and one universal (∀)), it’s effective to think of the statement as a two player game The existential player (variable) tries to make the expression true, while the universal player (variable) tries to make the expression false | The player (variable) on the left goes first, and the next player (variable) tries their best to succeed in their goal | Ex: In ∀x ∃y (x + y = 0), x goes first and chooses a random value; y tries its best to set x + y = 0 and is successful because it can always become -x | . | DeMorgan’s can be applied to nested quantifiers as well; it switches the signs of the quantifier to its opposite | . . . 1.10: More nested quantified statements . If you want to express ∀x ∀y without including situations where x == y, then you can write the proposition as ∀x ∀y ((x ≠ y) → M(x, y)) If x == y, then x, y cannot be used as a counter example because it’s not false | . | To express uniqueness, you can use a combination of nested quantifiers and conditionals | . . You can also move the quantifiers depending on where it is located in the statement | . . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.10.1 is good practice . . 1.11: Logical reasoning . Argument: A sequence of propsitions (AKA hypotheses) that is followed by a final proposition (AKA conclusion) Valid arguments have true conclusions when all hypotheses are true; invalid otherwise | ∴ symbol denotes “therefore” | Commutative law allows hypotheses to be in any order . | Ex: These two arguments are the same | Proving an arguments validity via truth table: . | You can prove that an argument is invalid by showing an example where the hypotheses are true but the conclusion is not | . | An argument’s form is found by replacing propositions with variables Ex: “It is raining today. + If it is raining today, I will not ride my bike to school. ∴ I will not ride my bike to school.” can be replaced with “p + (p –&gt; q) ∴ q” | Forms can be useful because it can invalidate an argument with known truth values Ex: | . | . | If an argument does not have an assignment where the hypotheses are true, then the argument is valid | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.11.1 is good practice . Questions: . What is the difference between (x != y) -&gt; and (x != y) ^? Is it because ^ is for existentials and -&gt; is for universals? .",

            "title": "Principles of Economics Ch. 1-3",
            "content": "Chapter 1: Ten Principles of Economics . By nature, resources are scarce, meaning that they are limited and not everyone can get whatever they want | Economics: study of how society manages its resources No one person controls all of the resources; every individual has a say in how a resource is distributed | Economists study how people make decisions based on resources (work, purchases, savings, etc.) | Economists also study larger forces/trends such as unemployment, income growth, inflation, etc. | . | . 1-1: How People Make Decisions . Summary: People make decisions based on what they have to give (opportunity cost) and comparing it to what they get. Rational people try to get the best outcome possible and use marginal changes to get the most out of their resources. Rational people also consider the costs and benefits of a purchase/behaving a certain way. . Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs . Most decisions require trade-offs; give something you like to get something you like | Types of trade-offs in society “Guns and butter”: The more spent on military/defense (guns), the less spent on quality of life goods (butter) Relates to trade-off between clean environment and high income; costs more for a factory to produce goods cleanly, so they might have to provide lower wages, charge higher prices, etc. | . | Efficiency and equality: getting the most out of a society’s resources vs. giving out products equally amongst members of the society (respectively) “Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices” | Efficiency and equality conflict with each other; giving poor people money (equality+) means that people may not work as hard and production goes down (efficiency-) | . | Trade-offs are key to understanding economics, as people try to make trade-offs most beneficial to them | . | . Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It . Opportunity cost: Everything you give up to get an item, including time, health, money, etc. Ex. Many athletes believe that spending 4 years in college has too high of an opportunity cost compared to going straight to a pro league | . | . Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin . Economy assumes people are rational, or that they try their hardest to get the best outcome | Decisions are not black and white (buy a 3m$ house or be homeless?), so rational people use marginal change to slowly adjust their plans in order to get the best result Marginal costs should be taken into account when making decisions | Ex. It’s free to watch another movie if you’ve already paid for a monthly subscription, or an airline can seat another person if they have empty seats; both marginal costs are zero | . | A classic example is “a cup of water vs. a diamond”; marginally, getting one more cup of water is much easier than getting a(nother) diamond, so water costs less | Rational decisions are ones where the marginal benefit (gaining one more unit) is greater than the marginal cost (how much does that extra unit cost?) | . Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives . Incentive: Something that encourages a person to act Ex. If apple prices rise, then consumers will buy fewer apples and producers will produce more apples | Public policymakers use incentives to affect the behaviors of citizens; taxing cigarettes causes less people to smoke | Incentives often affect cost-benefit calculations and must be taken into consideration | . | . 1-2: How People Interact . Summary: People trade in order to maximize their production, as trade allows for specialization. Markets facilitate trade, and governments often step in to ensure that the market runs smoothly. . Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off . Competition and trading can benefit all parties Each person trades goods (work, most commonly) for other goods (food, homes, cars, etc.); competitive pricing forces goods to have low prices, benefiting consumers | Not participating in trade/competition means that people would have to grow their own food, build their own house, etc. | Trading allows for specialization and more advanced societies | . | . Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity . Communism was founded on principle that the government should control the economy (central planning) AKA Command Economy | Most countries that had central planning stopped using it in favor of a market economy | Government decides on the producers, the level of output, the consumers; pretty much everything | . | Market Economy: an economy that is based on the decisions of individual households, companies, firms, etc. to exchange goods and services; decisions are made based on whatever is the most profitable/whatever provides the best outcome Can seem dangerous (no governing authority to ensure equality), but people make decisions as if guided by “an invisible hand (Adam Smith) | Prices are the main way the economy is controlled; determines the demand from buyers and the supply from sellers, thus displaying the value of a product to society | When a government interrupts the forces of natural supply and demand, the decisions of individuals don’t follow the invisible hand as much Shows why communism failed: prices didn’t change to reflect the true values of products | Leads to excesses and shortages because the government doesn’t know how much demand there is | . | Products such as Uber show the inner workings of market economies | . | . Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes . Governments are necessary to enforce rules that are important to a market economy These rules include property rights; individuals must be able to own and control their resources freely | . | Governments also choose whether or not to promote efficiency or equality Occasionally, a market failure occurs where a free market is inefficient in its distribution of resources; government must step in to make it efficient Can be caused by externality: the actions of one affects the health/well-being of another (such as pollution) Can negatively or positively affect consumption and production | Examples include smoking cigarettes, pollution, education, or a bee farm next to an orange orchard | . | Can also be caused by market power: one (or a few) person(s) or group(s) control a resource and can unnaturally change its price due to its necessity | Asymmetric Information: one party has more information than another; can lie and be dishonest with a price Adverse Selection: Market failure where products of lower quality are sold at the same price as those of higher quality; too many low quality products are sold | Moral Hazard: When a party can change their behavior without taking on risk, typically in the form of insurance | . | . | Free markets can cause large wealth disparities and inequalities; government can step in and provide basic goods + welfare for those at the bottom of the economic ladder | . | Public policy not always perfect; can be corrupted or abused | . 1-3: How the Economy as a Whole Works . Summary: Countries that are able to produce more goods and services have a higher standard of living. Printing can stimulate an economy, leading to the hiring of more workers, but it can also lead to higher inflation. Often, printing money (or the lack thereof) causes random business cycles. . Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services . Different countries have different qualities of life and average incomes; higher income == higher quality of life This difference relies on a countries’ productivity, or the goods/services output per unit of work input | Countries with higher productivities generally have a higher standard of living than countries with lower productivities This relationship means that other factors are far less important in determining standard of living | . | Policy makers must create policy based on increasing productivity | . | . Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money . Inflation: A rise in prices across an economy Inflation typically occurs because governments print money; more money –&gt; money is less valuable –&gt; prices increase | . | . Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment . Printing money stimulates the economy, causes companies to hire more people, and increases production BUT it causes higher prices in the long term Leads to business cycles: large, irregular, and unpredictable changes in economic activity | Government spending, printing, and taxing can all affect inflation, productivity, and more - it’s up for debate how much (if at all) the government should do | . | . . Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist . 2-1: The Economist as Scientist . Summary: Economists can act as a scientist in the sense that they create hypotheses in order to understand more about the field. They must make assumptions in order to form these hypotheses/conclusions. There are many models to represent an economy. There are two studies of economics: micro and macro. . The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation . Newton first observed an apple fall, created a theory about gravity, and observed to see if his theory was correct; this method can be applied to economics Ex. An economist could theorize that inflation and high prices were related, then gather data from countries and see if his theory is correct | . | Difference between traditional sciences and economics is that economics cannot create controlled experiments; they must make do with real world data Historical events often provide the best study cases for how a key resource affects an economy, such as wars in the Middle East | . | . The Role of Assumptions . Economists must make assumptions in order to simplify complex situations and clarify them Ex. Breaking down a complicated problem (analyzing international trade) into smaller parts (analyze trade between two countries and with two products) to better understand the concepts | . | The elegance of economics is deciding what assumptions to use Ex. When studying effects of inflation on price, you could assume that short term prices will stay similar while long term prices will fluctuate greatly | . | . Economic Models . Models often omit details to show what is really important and are built with assumptions | . Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram . Circular-flow diagram is used to show how groups in an economy interact with each other | In the diagram, households (consumers) and firms (producers) participate in two markets Markets for goods and services are ones where households buy the products of firms | Markets for the factors of production are ones where households provide input (labor, money, etc.) to firms for the firms to create goods and services | . | Inner loop represents the flow of inputs (labor, land, capital) and outputs (goods and services) | Outer loop represents the flow of dollars/money; paying wages, buying goods, etc. | Circular-flow diagram is good to understand how different parts of the economy interact | Assumed that there is no government intervention, foreign trade | . Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier . Most economic models are built using mathematics | The production possibilities frontier is a graph that displays the different levels of output for two goods (assuming that an economy only produces those two goods) | The outermost line represents the maximum efficiency of the economy (efficient combinations lie on this line); can only produce that many products given its resources Any points outside of the border (such as point C) cannot be reached in the current state of the economy | Any points inside of the border but not on the line (such as point D) are deemd inefficient because they don’t use the maximum amount of resources | . | The graph relates to both trade-offs and opportunity costs Trade-off between producing more/less of one product than the other | Opportunity cost is depends on the slope of the frontier; lower slope = lower opportunity cost, steeper slope = higher opportunity cost | . | Econoomists believe that production possibilities frontiers will generally have a curved shape Ex. If all of an economy’s resources (including car makers) are being used to make computers, then making one car will barely inhibit computer production and vice verse; leads to different slopes at the ends | . | Frontiers can shift depending on economic growth or change | The frontier establishes scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and growth; good model for demonstrating economics | . Microeconomics and Macroeconomics . Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms interact with each other and make decisions on a small scale (in one market, for example) | Macroeconomics: The study of how things can affect an entire economy | Both are tied to each other; impossible to understand macroeconomic concepts without knowing microeconomic ones Both fields are still very different, warranting different courses | . | . 2-2: The Economist as Policy Advisor . Summary: Economists can make either positive or normative statements. Policymakers listen to these statements and form laws based on the advice, though economists are not always listened to. . Positive versus Normative Analysis . A positive statement is objective and makes a statement about how the world is | A normative statement is subjective and makes a statement about how the world should be | Positive statements can be analyzed, rationed with, and (dis)proven, while normative statements must be evaluated using both facts and moral values | . Economists in Washington . Economists must describe both options to policy makers in order for them to make a well-informed decision | Economists give advice, formulate plans, design tax policy, analyze data, evalutate public policy, provide new insight through research and publications, and more | . Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed . Economic policy, in practice, cannot be enforced as it would be in theory | Lawmakers must appeal to the masses (as well as Congress) and change portions of suggested economic policy in order to do so | . 2-3: Why Economists Disagree . Summary: Economists disagree on issues because they have different values and may interpret data differently. However, there are many “controversial” issues that economists typically agree on. . Differences in Scientific Judgments . Economists are always trying to understand world economies, so they might disagree if they interpret certain discoveries differently This includes controversial concepts like supply-side economics and welfare | . | . Differences in Values . Economists may disagree on the “fairness” of policies based on their values or upbringings | . Perception versus Reality . Economists agree on many propositions that may be more controversial to the public, such as rent control and enforcing tariffs Despite the fact that economists agree, if politicans were to implement such policies (like rent control), they might not get reelected/lose popularity, thus causing contradictions between public policy and agreed upon propositions | . | . . Chapter 3: Interdependence and the Gains from Trade . 3-1: A Parable for the Modern Economy . Summary: Trade can benefit both parties even if one party is absolutely better than the other at producing a certain good. Trade allows for specialization. . Scenario: Let’s say there are two people, Ruby and Frank, and two goods, beef and potatoes Ruby can only produce beef and Frank can only produce potatoes | Both parties would benefit from trading with each other, as they would have more variety in their diets (beef + potatoes vs. only beef or only potatoes) | Can also trade other things; if Ruby can’t farm potatoes well and Frank can’t raise cattle, then they could trade farms | . | Guiding Question: What if one person is better at producing every good? | . Production Possibilities . Assuming that Frank and Ruby could work 8 hours a day, they can only devote so much time to raising cattle or growing potatoes | Production possibilities frontier for both farmers: These frontiers are not curved (or “bowed-out”) because each farmer’s efficiency remains the same regardless the amount of time spent on either task | . | The frontiers show us what would happen if both farmers were self sufficient and are good at displaying the trade-offs they make, but aren’t effective at showing what decisions they would make | . Specialization and Trade . Ruby tells Frank to spend all of his time farming potatoes (which he is more efficient at) | Ruby spends more of her time farming cattle (which she is better at than Frank) and some of her time growing potatoes | By specializing and trading their specialized goods, both farmers benefit and consume more of both foods | . 3-2: Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization** . Summary: Comparative advantage determines how trade is conducted; if both parties have a comparative advantage over one another, then they can export the good that they are more efficient in producing. For both parties to benefit, the price of trade should be between their opportunity costs. . Absolute Advantage . Absolute advantage is used to compare two firms, countries, people, etc.; one group has an absolute advantage if they use less inputs for the same output Ruby takes 20 minutes to make an ounce of meat and 10 minutes to make an ounce of potatoes, while Frank takes 60 and 15 minutes, respectively; Ruby has an absolute advantage over Frank | . | . Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage . In this scenario, opportunity cost represents the trade-off in time between producing meat and potatoes Ruby can make 2 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; her opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/2 ounce of meat | Frank can make 4 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; his opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/4 ounce of meat | . | Comparative advantage: Having a lower opportunity cost to produce a good compared to another producer Despite Frank being worse at producing both goods, he has a comparative advantage over Ruby because 1/4 &lt; 1/2 | One person cannot have a comparative advantage in both goods because the comparative advantages are inverse; if you have a low opportunity cost for one good, it’ll be higher for the other good | . | . Comparative Advantage and Trade . When people specialize in producing a good that they have a comparative advantage in, the total production of the economy rises, making everyone better off | By trading, people can obtain goods at a lower opportunity cost and therefore get more net goods | . The Price of Trade . To determine the price at which parties trade at, a general rule can be applied: For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between their opportunity costs Frank and Ruby trade at a price of 3 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat; Ruby’s opportunity cost is 2 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat and Frank’s is 4 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat | Any price between 2 and 4 would benefit both parties If below 2, then both parties would want to buy meat because it’s cheaper than their opportunity cost; if above 4, then both parties would want to sell meat because the price is higher than their opportunity cost | . | . | . 3-3: Applications of Comparative Advantage . Summary: Examples of how comparative advantages apply to the real world. . Should LeBron James Mow His Own Lawn? . James is a great athlete, but the time he wastes on mowing his lawn could be used on other things such as recording a commercial or otherwise Regular people have a comparative advantage over James, so James should hire people to mow his lawn for him (and compensate them at a price that is higher than their opportunity cost) | . | . Should the United States Trade with Other Countries? . Goods bought from abroad are called imports and goods sold to other countries are exports | If one country is more adept at producing a certain good compared to another country, then they should export that good while importing a good that said other country has a comparative advantage in | Trade can benefit both parties, but it may hurt individuals; importing cars and exporting farmed goods affects autoworkers and farmers differently | .",

            "content": "1.1: Propositions and logical operations . Proposition: A statement that is either true or false Does not include commands (Shut the door!) or questions (What time is it?) | Propositions have a truth value, can be either: true, false, unknown, or a matter of opinion | . | A compound proposition is the combination of propositions using a logical operator ∧ represents “and”; p ∧ q is true if both p and q are true AKA conjunction operator | Truth table: | . | ∨ represents “or”; p ∨ q is true if either p or q are true AKA disjunction operator | Truth Table: | . | In English, “or” is typically used to represent “either/or”, or exclusive or (represented by ⊕), where both conditions cannot be true at the same time (She is eating or running) Only difference is that T ⊕ T == F while T ∨ T == T | ∨ represents inclusive or where both conditions CAN be true at the same time | . | ¬ represents negation, or NOT; ¬True == False and ¬False == True | . | . . 1.2 Evaluating compound propositions . Compound propositions can have more than one operation Order of operations w/o parantheses: ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or) | Good practice to use parantheses | . | Truth tables will contain 2n rows for n variables(2 options for each variable) | Rightmost variable is filled in with TFTF…, leftmost is filled in with TTFF…; T and F alternates based on 2column number where rightmost column = 1 | . | Example of a truth table with intermediate steps: | . . 1.3 Conditional statements . Conditional operations are represented with the symbol → p → q is read as “if p then q” | Truth table: | Think of it as a contract; if condition one is fulfilled, then the second condition HAS to be fulfilled, but if condition one is not fulfilled, then the second condition can either be fulfilled or not. | Different ways to express conditional operations: | p only if q is also p → q; most confusing one | . | Related conditional statements include the contrapositive, converse, and inverse The converse of p → q is q → p | The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p | The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q | . | Biconditional operations are represented with ↔ p ↔ q stands for “p if and only if q” - AKA true if p == q and false if not | If and only if can be represented with iff | . | Conditional and biconditional operations can be used in conjunction with other operations ∧, ∨, and ¬ takes precedence before → or ↔ | . | . . 1.4 Logical equivalence . A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, while a contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false p ∨ ¬p is a tautology, while p ∧ ¬p is a contradiction | . | Logical equivalence means that two compound propositions always return the same value ≡ is used to denote logical equivalence | If s ≡ r, then s ↔ r is a tautology, and s ≡ r if and only if r ≡ s | . | De Morgan’s Laws are laws that use logical equivalences to show how to distribute negation, or NOT, operations First version of the law: ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q) or !(p or q) == !p and !q | Second version of the law: ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) or !(p and q) == !p or !q | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.4.1 is a great capstone activity for practice . . 1.5 Laws of propositional logic . You can substitute a proposition in for another one if both propositions are logically equivalent ex: Because p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q, (p ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ≡ (p ∨ r) ∧ (p → q) | Useful laws for logical equivalence: | . | .
