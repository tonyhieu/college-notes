            "content": "5.1: An introduction to Boolean algebra . Boolean algebra: a set of rules and operations for working with variables with values of 0 or 1; similar to propositional logic Boolean multiplication: Denoted by • and works the same as regular multiplication, logically the same as ∧ Table: | . | Boolean addition: Denoted by + and works the same as regular addition except 1 + 1 = 1, logically the same as ∨ Table: | . | Complement: Denoted by an over bar, works the same as the ¬ operator: 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0 | . | Relates to digital logic which is used to create computers | Variables that have a value of 1 or 0 are called Boolean variables, and Boolean expressions can be created by using Boolean operations on Boolean variables | Rules of precedence for boolean operations: Boolean multiplication takes precedence over Boolean addition. | The complement operation is applied as soon as the entire expression under the bar is evaluated. | Parentheses can be used to override the precedence rules. | . | Two Boolean expressions are equivalent if, for any combination of values of its variables, they have the same value Laws of Boolean algebra: | . | . 5.2: Boolean functions . Boolean functions map multiple Boolean input values to the set {0, 1} Can be represented by an input/output table (similar to a truth table) but is not feasible for larger numbers of inputs, as the outputs are equal to 2k where k = the number of inputs | Can express functions using Boolean expressions | . | Steps to derive a Boolean function via table: Literal: One expression that either equals a variable or a variable’s complement | Must take the minterm (a group of literals that make each variable equal 1) of each row that equals 1 | . | . 5.3: Disjunctive and conjunctive normal form . The disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a Boolean expression that is the sum of products of literals Example: | . | The conjunctive normal form (DNF) is a Boolean expression that is the sum of sums of literals Example: | . | . 5.4: Functional completeness . A set of operations is functionally complete if any Boolean expression can be rewritten using the set {addition, multiplication, complement} is functionally complete | {multiplication, complement} is also functionally complete because addition can be rewritten with multiplication: | {addition, complement} is also functionally complete because multiplication can be rewritten as addition: | . | NAND operation is denoted by ↑ and returns the complement of Boolean multiplication | NOR operation is denoted by ↓ and returns the complement of Boolean addition Tables for NAND and NOR: | . | One way to test functional completeness is to start with a known set and try replacing one of the operations with another | . 5.5: Boolean satisfiability . The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem asks if a Boolean expression can possibly evaluate to 1 If you can set it equal to 1, then it is satisfiable; if not, it is unsatisfiable | A particular set of values satisfies a Boolean expression if it makes it equal to 1 | There is no sufficient, fast method to solve SAT, as you have to check each input | . | If an expression is in DNF form, then it is easy to check if the expression is satisfiable Check if one of the literals does NOT contain a variable and its complement | . | In the CNF form, it is harder to check if the expression is satisfiable; you must check if each of the constraints equals 1 given a set of input values | . 5.6: Gates and circuits . Boolean algebra is used to create circuits an electronic devices A circuit built from electrical devices is called a gate, and a gate receives an input of Boolean values and returns an output | AND gates represent Boolean multiplication, OR gates represent Boolean addition, and the inverter represents the complement | Can combine gates together to create complex functions | . | This class will focus only on combinatorial circuits which do not store variables or loop Combinatorial circuits compute a Boolean function | Finding a Boolean function from a circuit: | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 10: Externalities . Externality: When the actions of one person affects another without paying or receiving compensation If the effect is bad, it is a negative externality, but if it’s good, then it’s a positive externality | Externalities cause the market equiblibrium to become inefficient, especially if buyers and sellers do not take them into account For example, pollution can seriously damage an economy over time, so it’s inefficient to support it | Governments must create laws in order to change the behaviors of those in the market and to dampen the effects of externalities | . | . | . 10-1: Externalities and Market Inefficiency . Welfare Economics: A Recap . The market equilibrium will always adjust to maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus | . Negative Externalities . Suppose the market for steel produces pollution, and for each unit produced, an amount of pollution enters the atmosphere | This externality increases the cost of producing steel as a whole; the social cost equals the cost of pollution to society as a whole plus the cost to the producer | To create a better equilibrium, the entire social cost needs to be taken into account Raising the price of a good (through taxes or otherwise) to better reflect its social cost is called internalizing the externality because it makes buyers and sellers think about the consequences of their decisions | . | . . Positive Externalities . Some activities can bring benefits to third parties, such as education Even if only one person is smarter, society as a whole becomes more intelligent, workers become more specialized, etc. | . | Positive externalities are similar to negative ones in the sense that the total social value of a good may not be realized The government can internalize the externality and incentivize education through subsdizing public schools | . | . . General rule of thumb: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the externality by taxing goods with negative externalities and subsidizing goods with positive externalities. | . 10-2: Public Policies toward Externalities . Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation . Command-and-control policies directly affect consumer behavior Examples include illegalizing the dumping of toxic chemicals into the water supply | . | Most cases of pollution are not as simple, and it is nigh impossible to illegalize all sources of pollution (such as transpotation) | Regulation is difficult and requires much research and deliberation | . Market-Based Policy 1: Corrective Taxes and Subsidies . Instead of directly regulating behavior, the government can incentivize their citizens to act a certain way throuh market-based policies For example, they can tax goods with negative externalities and subsidize goods with positive ones | . | Taxes created to deal with negative externalities are called corrective taxes (also called Pigovian taxes) | Corrective taxes are generally preferred to regulations Suppose one market is more effective than another at reducing pollution, and a tax is levied on each unit of pollution produced; the more efficient market is incentivized to reduce pollution by a lot more | The tax places a price on the right to pollute, and it allocates the cost of pollution to factories who produce the most of it | Taxes also provide an incentive to reduce pollution by as much as possible instead of just hitting the required quota | . | Corrective taxes are a much more positive tax than the ones previously discussed | . Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits . Suppose that a regulation of 300 tons of pollution is in place, and a paper and steel mill come to the EPA with a deal The paper mill will reduce its pollution to 200 tons while the steel mill increases its pollution to 400 tons, and the steel mill will play $5 million to the paper mill | This deal creates a new good, pollution permits, and is good for economic efficiency A market to trade permits will emerge, and the right to pollute will be bought by those who value it the most (i.e. those who are unable to efficiently reduce the amount of pollution they produce) | The existence of pollution permits causes the price of pollution to go up; buyers must buy pollution permits, and sellers don’t realize the income from selling a pollution permit if they continue to pollute | . | Both corrective taxes and pollution permits interalize the externality of pollution | . | Graph that shows the effect of both policies: . | In both cases, the EPA determines the price of pollution, either by imposing a price or creating a supply of pollution permits that is perfectly inelastic The choice between corrective taxes and pollution permits boils down to known information If the government knows that the external cost of pollution is $50,000 per unit, then they should tax | If the gogvernment knows how much they want to reduce pollution by, then they should auction off as many pollution permits as would allow the amount to go down | . | . | . Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution . Environmentalists argue that pollution should not be given a fee, as clean water and air are human rights that should not be thought of as monetary | Economists believe that people face trade-offs; clean water and air has a value, but eliminating all pollution is impossible, as it would lead to a lower standard of living A clean environment can be thought of as another good, and it has an income elasticity associated with it as well as a demand/supply curve | . | . 10-3: Private Solutions to Externalities . The Types of Private Solutions . Moral codes and social judgemnts can solve externalities For example, not many people litter because they are taught as children not to | . | Charities can leverage private donations to solve externalities, and schools receive donations/gifts from private parties all the time | Self-interest can internalize the externality Integrating businesses Suppose an apple orchard and bee farm are next to each other; the bees use the apples’ pollen, and the apples are pollinated by the bees, but the two firms don’t plant enough apples/create enough beehives to be completely efficient | Combining the two farms would interalize the externality | . | Creating contracts Creating a contract between the apple grower and beekeepr could specify the number of apple trees/beehives to solve the inefficiency | . | . | . The Coase Theorem . The Coase theorem stipulates that, if private parties can bargain over the allocation of resources, then they can always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently | Suppose that Emily has a dog that barks and disturbs her neighbor, Horace If Horace offers Emily money to get rid of the dog, then they can accurately determine the value of having the dog/getting rid of the dog for each person | If Emily values the dog more than Horace’s offer, then the allocation is efficient; if Horace offers enough money for Emily to get rid of the dog, then the allocation is efficient | . | Suppose that Horace has the legal right to peace and quiet Coase theorem states that the distribution of rights does not matter | Horace can legally compel Emily to get rid of the dog, but Emily can provide a counteroffer of money for Horace to not pursue legal action | The situation is the same; if Emily offers enough money, then Horace won’t get rid of the dog, but if she doesn’t, he will, leaqding to an efficient allocation of resources | . | The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome is efficient. | . Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work . Private parties often fail to resolve the problems of externalities | Transaction costs, or costs that parties incur while bargaining, can hamper the ability to solve an externality problem Suppose that Emily and Horace spoke different languages; the cost of hiring translators might outweigh the value of solving the problem which could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources | . | Bargaining offers can also break down If Horace offers a price below his value to remove the dog and Emily counteroffers a price above her value to keep it, then negotiations could fail | . | Efficient bargains become increasingly difficult when the number of involved parties is large If a factory pollutes a fishing lake, it could be difficult to get all of the local fishermen to make a deal with the factory | . | . Chapter 11: Public Goods and Common Resources . 11-1: The Different Kinds of Goods . There are different kinds of goods; a market for ice cream is easy to make efficient, but a market for clean air is not | Two different characteristics of goods Excludability: How easy it is to prevent someone from using a good; if you can’t prevent someone from using it, then it’s not excludable | Rivalry in consumption: If one person’s use of a good reduces another person’s ability to use it, then it is a rival in consumption (similar to a zero sum game) | . | These two characteristics creates four categories Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption, makes up most of the goods in the economy: you must pay for it to use it, and if you use it, someone else can’t | Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in competition, makes up goods/services that are provided by the government or nature | Common resources are rival in competition but not excludable, makes up goods that anyone has access to | Club goods are excludable but not rival in competition, makes up services that you must pay to use | Table of categories: | The categories can blur based on factors such as population or government control, but they are useful for making generalizations | . | . 11-2: Public Goods . For this section, consider a fireworks display, which is neither excludable nor rival in competition | . The Free-Rider Problem . Say that a town with 500 residents place a 10$ value on watching the fireworks on the 4th of July If the fireworks cost the government $1000, then there is a total surplus of $4000 if there is no fee | The citizens are free riders; they receive the benefit without paying for it | . | A private market would not work, as the citizens of the town would not purchase a ticket to watch fireworks that they could watch for free This results in a market failure | The market failure arises because of an externality; if a private firm put on a firework show, then there are people who can watch it without paying for it, thus causing a third party to gain a benefit without paying Causes economic inefficiency | . | . | The issue can be resolved by levying a tax and then the government using the revenue from said tax to pay a private firm to put on the fireworks | Because public goods are not excludable, the free-rider problem prevents an efficient, private market for them from arising | . Some Important Public Goods . National Defense No one can be excluded from defense after it is set up, and the defense of one person doesn’t detract from the defense of another; neither excludable nor rival in competition | Extremely expensive to provide | . | Basic Research Complicated and specific research can be patented and therefore excluded, but general knowledge cannot; once a theorem is proven, anyone can use it without restricting others’ access to it | Firms spend money on specific research in order to make money, but they do not spend resources on basic research Public policy (in the form of patents) is therefore required in order to incentivize research | Basic research is subsidized as well | . | . | Fighting Poverty The government helps the poor in order to provide equality; doesn’t exclude their services and they try to help as many people as possible | Cannot create a private market for fighting poverty because of the free market problem | . | . The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis . The government must choose which public goods to provide and in how much quantity Must use a cost-benefit analysis in order to determine which goods to provide | Difficult to determine the true value provided by a public good because there is no “price tag” on it; must use approximations | . | . 11-3: Common Resources . The fact that common resources are rival in competition gives way to the Tragedy of the Commons | . The Tragedy of the Commons . Suppose there is a grass field that a medieval town shares to graze sheep When there few sheperds, everyone can use the grass field, but after the population grows, the grass field becomes barren and doesn’t regrow | The reason for the destruction is because social and private incentives don’t mesh; sheperds want to use the field as much as possible, but it’s better for the community if they use it more sparingly | . | The Tragedy of the Commons arises when a common resource is overused and its quality deteriorates as a result | Common resources are often used excessively (because no one wants to be the one who is at a disadvantage for not using it), and the government must regulate or tax it in order to regulate consumption | . Some Important Common Resources . Clean Air and Water Pollution can negatively affect clean air and water because firms take it for granted, and overfishing can also ruin clear water | . | Congested Roads Once a road is congested, its use negatively affects other people’s use of it - it becomes a common resource | One way to prevent road congestion is to add a tax or toll and raise the toll during rush hours | Another way is to add a tax to gasoline which will prevent as many people from driving Not preferred because it can have other effects; it also disincentivizes driving in general | . | . | Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife Many animals are common resources, and most people have little incentive to keep the population up, so overfishing and whaling is a possible issue | Oceans are one of the least regulated common resources, as many countries have access to it and it’s difficult to enforce an agreement | Within nations, governments can more regulate fishing such as through the use of hunting/fishing licenses | . | .",

Lawrence’s book Pornography and Obscenity, Lawrence argues that such stories should be shared in order to have a more open discussion about sex The story is also seen as extremely obscene and misogynistic | . | Boccaccio is offering a parody of the “monk going out to the desert to become spiritually enlightened” trope (Journey to the West) The Life of Maria the Harlot in particular was a very similar story that followed a young girl who lived in the desert as a hermit Maria becomes seduced by a monk after she lives there for 18 years | Maria turns to prostitution because she is ashamed, and her uncle visits her (pretending to be a customer) and tells her that she should not be ashamed | Maria dies a saint in the desert | . | . | Comparisons between Maria and Alibech Maria’s uncle exhibits paternal love and responsibility while Rustico acts as a father figure and seduces/rapes her | Both are seduced by a monk in the desert, but Maria is ashamed while Alibech is not | Maria willingly leaves the city to return to the desert while Alibech is reluctant to leave the desert and go to the city | Maria experiences trauma from her sexual experience while Alibech does not and wears out Rustico instead | . | Boccaccio argues that sex is human behavior and a necessary evil Both Rustico and Alibech fall victim to their sexual desires | Alibech thinks of her sexual experience as a one-time thing while Rustico knows that he is sinning | Rustico acts in bad faith but Alibech does not | Alibech represents innocence | . | Alibech lives in a sinless world; she doesn’t feel guilt because she believes her motives are pure Women tell her that her new husband will help with those motives | Alibech represents a “pure” sexual drive, while Rustico represents a sinful one | . | Rustico’s sins First sin was pride, believed that he could resist the temptations of Alibech’s young body but failed | Second sin was lust, could not recognize the control lust had over him | Alibech commits neither of those sins, and her sexual drive is approved in this story through marriage and bearing children | . | Alibech’s blameless behavior Boccaccio believes that if one has pure intentions, then they will earn God’s grace | . | Keep III.10 in mind while reading IV.1 Boccaccio achieves a comic effect through merging eroticism and asceticism | Alibech’s experience is predicated on her innocence, and she has to face the city and face its social constructs after leaving the desert | How is this similar to what the brigata memebers must do after they leave the palace? | . | . | Brief thoughts on Bocaccio’s “On Poetry” and the defense of figurative thinking Excerpt from a larger work where Bocaccio discusses the family histories of pagan Greco-Roman gods | Boccaccio defends literary writing and poetry which is the main idea of the Decameron | Insists that writing often has “hidden” meanings which is the main benefit of poetry | Boccaccio argues for studying texts and finding deeper meaning; refers to Biblical texts, such as when Jessu spoke in parables | . | .",

Function: Maps elements from one set to another using some sort of operation Can be represented as a set and as a subset of X × Y such that for every x ∈ X, there is exactly one y ∈ Y for which (x, y) ∈ f | f: X -&gt; Y is used to show that f is the function that maps set X to Y | Set X is the domain of the function while set Y is the target or co-domain of the function | “f maps x to y” can be written as (x, y) ∈ f and can also be denoted as f(x) = y | If a function maps an element of the domain to either 0 elements or &gt;1 element, then it is not well-defined | An element is in the range of f if there is an x ∈ X such that (x, y) ∈ f Alternate definition: Range of f = { y: (x, y) ∈ f, for some x ∈ X } | . | . | A function that has a finite domain can be shown graphically as an arrow diagram Example: | Non well-defined function example: | . | A function definition is incomplete without specifying the domain and target Correct: g: R → R, where g(x) = |x| | Incorrect: g(x) = |x| | . | . 4.2: Floor and ceiling functions . Floor function: Function that maps a real number to its closest integer, rounded down Definition: floor: R → Z, where floor(x) = the largest integer y such that y ≤ x. | Notated as such: | . | Ceiling function: Function that maps a real number to its closest integer, rounded down Definition: ceiling: R → Z, where ceiling(x) = the smallest integer y such that x ≤ y. | Notated as such: | . | . 4.3: Properties of functions . A function is one-to-one or injective if each value of x maps to a unique value of y x1 ≠ x2 implies that f(x1) ≠ f(x2) | . | A function is onto or surjective if the range of f is equal to its target For every y ∈ Y, there is an x ∈ X such that f(x) = y | . | A function is bijective if it is both onto and one-to-one Such functions are called bijections or one-to-one correspondences | . | Can infer the sizes, or cardinality, of the domain and target sets depending on the function’s properties If f: D → T is onto, then for every element in the target, there is at least one element in the domain: |D| ≥ |T|. | If f: D → T is one-to-one, then every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the target: |D| ≤ |T|. | If f: D → T is a bijection, then f is one-to-one and onto: |D| ≤ |T| and |D| ≥ |T|, which implies that |D| = |T|. | Visual: | . | . Challenge Activity is good to practice onto vs. one-to-one . 4.4: The inverse of a function . The inverse of a function is found by reversing the order of its tuples; that is, f-1 = { (y, x) : (x, y) ∈ f }. Inverses may not be well-defined, so some functions don’t have inverses | Example: | A function has an inverse if and only if it is a bijection | Analytically solving for the inverse of a function with an infinite domain: | . | . 4.5: Composition of functions . A composition of functions is when a function is applied to another function Example: f(g(x)), or (f ο g)(x) | Visual example: | . | The identity function (denoted by I) takes a set and maps each of its elements onto itself If a function f has an inverse, then f composed with its inverse is an identity function | Mathematical definitions: (f o f-1)(x) = If | Let f: A → B be a bijection. Then f-1 ο f = IA and f ο f-1 = IB. | . | . | . 4.6: Logarithms and exponents . Exponential function and logarithmic function are featured Properties of exponents: | Properties of logarithms: | . | A function is strictly increasing if, for each increasing value of x, f(x) is bigger than the last if whenever x1 &lt; x2, then f(x1) &lt; f(x2) | . | A function is strictly decreasing if, for each increasing value of x, f(x) is smaller than the last if whenever x1 &lt; x2, then f(x1) &gt; f(x2) | . | Logarithmic function is strictly increasing | .",

Ciappelletto is the first “model” storyteller | The rest of the stories fall under Ciappelletto’s; signifies following stories will be raunchy but attempt to appeal to God | . | Day 1 Tales 2, 3, and 4 relate to religion | 2 talks about a Jewish merchant who notices that the Church is corrupt but is prospering because of it, making Christianity favorable; merchant’s reasoning | 3 has a “wise” Jew tell a tale within the tale about how it’s impossible to know which of the major religions was valid; uses metaphor of three brothers with three rings with none of them knowing which ring is real | 4 shows a monk exposing the hypocrisy of his Abbot by playing a trick on him even though the Abbot planned to expose the monk’s trick | . | Bocaccio intends to show that religious officials are not above “regular” humans and are not in a position to judge Also argues that all faiths are similar | Uses merchants to show that you need to work together to prosper | . | . | Day 2’s theme is “reversals of bad to good fortune” | Continues general theme of intelligence | Merchants become frequent protagonists | Day 2 Story 5 takes the form of a folk/fairy tale and shows the romances of education Starts as a typical exposition of a folk tale; Andreuccio hears of Naples and brings 500 gold to make his fortune there | Switch in perspective from Andreuccio to the Sicilian woman | Situational irony: Andreuccio has no knowledge of his situation, but the reader/other characters in the story do | Perugia stands for the land of innocence while Naples stands for the land of cunning and trickery | Story takes place as a series of journeys Perugia to Naples | The journey inside of Naples: inn, market, Malportugia, church/tomb, well | Parody of the “journey to the underworld” | . | Trebling: patterns of three Bocaccio uses trebling to show Andreuccio’s education | Andreuccio falls three times, and each time, he goes into darkness and gains a little bit more insight Fall 1: Falls into the toilet, realizes that he’s been tricked, leaves while naked and covered in sewage | Fall 2: Meets two men who inform him that he would have been killed had he not fallen Is lowered into a well in order to clean up, but the two thieves leave him while guards come | Develops suspicion but still doesn’t know where he’s going | . | Fall 3: Goes into the tomb and grabs the jewelry off of the Archbishop’s finger Understands that the two thieves are trying to trick him, takes the ring and lies to the thieves | Left for dead inside of the tomb, faints and is described as looking like a corpse | . | Andreuccio is able to free himself from the last fall by grabbing the leg of another thief “Resurrected” as a new man who is no longer innocence | . | . | . | Perspective changes throughout the story We are never “with” Andreuccio until when he is in the tomb; always above/below/removed from him | Signals that the listener’s should have empathy only when Andreuccio is in the tomb, as we gain information from him | . | Each fall is a mock version of different moments on a spiritual journey as told on the Christian calendar Fall 1: fall into filth and sin, leaving Eden and going to the real world | Fall 2: Baptism, cleansing of sin | Fall 3: sacrament of Confirmation; Confirmation shows proof that one is Christian, an adolescent kisses the ring on a bishop’s finger Entry into the “light” of Christian knowledge, symbolized by the theives’ lantern | Andreuccio literally steals the ring | . | Has references to Dante, especially in Dante’s books and worlds (Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise) | . | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 8: Application: The Costs of Taxation . 8-1: The Deadweight Loss of Taxation . How a Tax Affects Market Participants . Recall that the benefit received by buyers is the consumer surplus and the benefit received by sellers is the producer surplus | The tax revenue that the government receives is the size of the tax times the quantity of a good; T x Q Graph: | . | The following graph and bullets represent what taxes do to an economy’s well-being: | Welfare without a Tax The total surplus in a market is reprsented by the entirety of the triangle up to the equilibrium point, as the government isn’t driving a tax wedge into it | . | Welfare with a Tax With the tax, both the consumer and producer surplus is stifled; they only receive a surplus of sizing of triangles A and F, respectively | . | Changes in Welfare After the tax, both consumers and producers are left worse off while the government is better for it | The drop in total surplus is called the deadweightloss and is represented by the area of C + E | . | . Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade . Scenario of how taxes cause deadweight losses: Imagine a cleaner, Malik, and a homeowner, Mei Mei’s value of cleaning the house is $120, and Malik’s cost is $80, so a fair pricing would be $100 (surplus of $40) | If the government levies a $50 tax, there is no good pricing for Malik and Mei If Mei pays $120, then Malik only receives $70 | If Malik charges $80, then Mei pays $130 | . | Business is called off, thus resulting in a deadweight loss | . | Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade. | The graph from before represents the deadweight loss, as those closer to the equilibrium point are closer to the margin and will thus stop doing business if it stops being lucrative | . 8-2: The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss . When the supply/demand is elastic, then the size of the deadweight loss increases drastically, as more buyers/sellers are willing/able to exit the market | Visual Representation: | General rule: the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the larger the deadweight loss of a tax. | . 8-3: Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary . The size of the tax can change the deadweight loss and tax revenue | If the tax is too small, then the government might not realize enough revenue, but if the tax is too large, then it may shrink the market can cause the government (and market) to fail | Graphics: | The size of the deadweight loss is exponential compared to the size of the tax If a tax doubles, then the width and height of the deadweight loss doubles, thus making it increase by a factor of 4 | . | . Lecture Notes . A subsidy actually hurts the total surplus of an economy, as pushing the quantity past its equilibrium leads to a loss in surplus | . Chapter 9: Application: International Trade . 9-1: The Determinants of Trade . The Equilibrium without Trade . Scenario: Imagine a country named Isoland with a textile market that is isolated from the rest of the world Because they are isolated, the textile market consists only of Isolandian buyers and sellers | Graph: | . | A new president is elected and advocates for free trade, asks three questions: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the domestic textile market? | Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the gains exceed the losses? | Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy | | . The World Price and Comparative Advantage . First question that must be asked is whether or not Isoland will be a textile exporter or importer | Economists must compare the current Isolandian price of textiles to other prices of textiles; the current, prevailing price worldwide is called the world price If the world price is greater than the domestic price, then Isoland will become an exporter (producer); if it is lower, then Isoland will become an importer (consumer) | Shows if Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles, thus clarifying what Isoland should specialize in | . | . 9-2: The Winners and Losers from Trade . Must begin with the assumption that Isoland is a small economy and that its actions will have a negligible effect on the world markets; specifically, Isoland will not affect the world price of textiles Economies that cannot affect the price are called price takers; they take the world price | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an exporting country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles rises to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity suppplied is higher than the domestic quantity demanded, but that’s ok because the surplus is sold off as export | Though quantities differ, the world market as a participant keeps the domestic market in equilibrium The horziontal line for world price represents the completely elastic world demand for textiles | . | There are pros and cons; the domestic price increases, so domestic producers are better off while domestic consumers are not The total surplus increases at the cost of consumer surplus; sellers beenfit much more in an exporting country than consumers | . | Two conclusions can be made: When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good are worse off. | Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. | . | . The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country . Assume that Isoland becomes an importing country | After trade is allowed, the domestic price of textiles lowers to the world price of textiles Graph: | . | The domestic quantity demanded is higher than the domestic quantity suppplied, but that’s ok because the shortage is bought as import | The supply curve is elastic because Isoland can buy as much of the good as they want at the world price | . The Effects of a Tariff . Tariff: A tax on imported goods from other countries A tariff does not apply to an exporting country because no one would import goods | . | Graph that shows the effect of a tariff: Area D represents the loss from the overproduction of textiles, while area F represents the loss from the underconsumption of textiles Tariff incentivizes marginal sellers to produce at a profit because the tariff raises the price | Tariff deincentivizes marginal buyers to purchase because the tariff raises the price | . | . | After the tariff, the price of the good rises to the equilibrium price before opening up to international trade Domestic sellers are better off (sell at a higher price), domestic buyers are worse off (buy at a higher price), and the government gains rvenue | . | There is a deadweight loss, but it does not amount to the increase in surplus compared to a purely domestic market | . Other Benefits of International Trade . Increased variety of goods: Different goods can only be produced in different countries | Lower costs through economies of scale: Some goods have lower costs of production if created in bulk; having specialized countries allows for a more efficient allocation of resources | Increased competition: Less likelihood of overwhelming market power because the market is bigger | Increased productivity: Only the most productive firms survive and thrive, thus increasing productivity | Enhanced flow of ideas: Import of advanced technologies can help developing countries develop faster | . 9-3: The Arguments for Restricting Trade . The Jobs Argument . Importing goods could destroy domestic firms and cause a lack of jobs Quite the opposite; new jobs open up as a result of trade (merchants, ambassadors, etc.) | Workers in inefficient industries move to advantageous ones | . | Isoland will always have a comparative advantage in some good, so there will always be jobs | . The National-Security Argument . If a domestic market for defense is non-existent (i.e. gun industry, or steel industry to make weaponry), then if war breaks out, the country will be vulnerable due to its dependencies on other countries Argument is legitimate but may be used too liberally; companies who wish to protect their own interests may push the argument extremely fast and exaggerate their roles in national security | . | Some may see a lower steel price as a way to stockpile weaponry at a lower cost | . The Infant-Industry Argument . New industries might ask for protection from foreign industries in order to get off the ground and become competitive Old industries might ask the same in order to adjust to new conditions | Hard to implement and determine effectiveness; must determine which industries will become profitable and if that protection is worth it Picking such industries is difficult, and protections may be more permanent than temporary due to lobbying | . | . | Argument is flawed; if an industry is projected to be profitable, then owners would take a loss in the short term in order to gain in the long run | . The Unfair-Competition Argument . Different laws in different countries can make it hard for some countries to compete If one country provides subsidies or allows for child labor, then they will have an advantage | . | Lower price is not a bad thing; it just means that the country is not competitive in that industry alone and can instead focus on other industries If foreign industries are subsidized, then there is a lower cost of good and no waste of taxpayer dollars | . | . The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument . Governments can threaten and use tariffs as a way to remove other tariffss and lead to freer trade If the threat doesn’t work, then imposing the tariff would hurt the economic welfare of a country, and if a country doesn’t follow through with its tariff, then it loses its standing and reputation | . | . Lecture Notes . Ricardian Trade Model: Gains in trade are due to differences in opportunity costs (AKA comparative advantage) | Quota: A limit on the quantity of imports Same effect as a tariff, but there is no tax revenue, so the decrease in total surplus is even greater | . | Collective Protection Problem Few producers vs. many consumers, easier to organize | . | .",

Welfare Economics: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being Answers questions about how to best organize economic activity | . | . 7-1: Consumer Surplus . Willingness to pay . Willingness to pay: The maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good; represents what a buyer values a good at | Consider the following scenario where four people want to buy an album: | . Buyer Willingness to Pay . Taylor | 100 | . Carrie | 80 | . Rihanna | 70 | . Gaga | 50 | . In an auction, the price would raise to 80$, and Taylor would buy it at 80$ or more (because Carrie is unwilling to pay more) Taylor’s consumer surplus is her willingness to pay minus the price she paid | If there are two albums to sell, then both Taylor and Carrie receive a consumer surplus, and the total market consumer surplus rises | . | . Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus . Can use the demand schedule shown above to create a demand curve Price is represented by the marginal buyer, or the buyer that would leave if the price was raised | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the album drops according to each buyer’s willingness to pay | The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | Demand curve represents maximum willingness to pay | . How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus . At lower prices, the price of the good is lower than more consumers’ value of the good, thus leading to a higher consumer surpus | Graph: | . What Does Consumer Surplus Measure? . Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being from the perspective of the buyers, as they are getting good value | Consumer surplus can sometimes be ignored in a market; lowering the price of heroine is not good but would increase consumer surplus | . 7-2: Producer Surplus . Cost and the Willingness to Sell . Cost: The value of everything (resources, manpower, time) that a seller uses to produce a good, essentially equivalent to willingness to sell | Consider the following scenario where four sellers are competing to paint a house: | . Seller Cost . Vincent | 900 | . Claude | 800 | . Pablo | 600 | . Andy | 500 | . In an auction, the price would start high and quickly lower to 500$; Andy would offer a price of 600$ or slightly lower and take the job (because Pablo is unwilling to sell for lower than 600$) Andy’s consumer surplus is the price he sells his service at minus his cost of production | If there are two houses to paint, then Pablo and Andy will both receive a producer surplus, and the total market producer surplus rises | . | . Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus . Can use the supply schedule shown above to create a supply curve Price is represented by the marginal seller, or the seller that would leave if the price was lowered | Graph: | Depending on the quantity, the price of the service raises according to each seller’s cost | The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. | Graph: | . | . How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus . A higher price increases producer surplus because more producers get a higher profit margin for their service | Graph: | . 7-3: Market Efficiency . The Benevolent Social Planner . Consider a dictator who wants to maximize economic well-being in society | Can calculate total surplus in a market by adding consumer and producer surplus Total surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers = Buyers’ willingness to pay - Sellers’ cost | . | An allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus exhibits **efficiency** Inefficient allocations include ones where producers are, wastefully, having higher costs to produce or ones where goods aren’t consumed by buyers who value them the most | . | Equality: Whether buyers and sellers both have similar levels of economics well-being | Thinking of the market as a pie, efficiency attempts to make the pie as big as possible while equality attempts to split it evenly | . Evaluating the Market Equilibrium . At the equilibrium, the buyers who value the good the most and the sellers who have the lowest cost both consume/produce the good; therefore, the market equilibrium represents the greatest total surplus Graph: | . | Free markets also naturally produce the quantity of goods which maximize total surplus; reducing the quantity creates a shortage, while increasing the quantity creates a surplus Graph: | . | The benevolent dictator need not intervene; the invisible hand of the market will do everything for them | .",

The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of demand: how much the quantity demanded changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in demand in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Factors of price elasticity of demand Availability of Close Substitutes: Goods with substitutes are elastic while those without are not | Necessities vs. Luxuries: Necessities are inelastic (demand will always remain the same) while luxuries are elastic | Definition of the Market: Items in a broad market (food industry) are more inelastic due to the lack of close substitutes, while items in a narrow market (vanilla ice cream) are elastic | Time Horizon: Good become more elastic with time; short term changes may be small, but long term ones are bigger | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand . Formula for price elasticity of demand is defined as: A note about the formule; the change in quantity demanded is negative, while the change in price is positive. Economists use the absolute value to make it easier | . | . The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities . If you use the above formula to calculate elasticity, then the elasticity from Point A to Point B may be different than Point B to Point A | Midpoint formula is better suited: Doesn’t change based on direction | . | Concept is more important than calculation for this book | . The Variety of Demand Curves . Demand is elastic when elasticity is greater than one and inelastic if not When the elasticity is equal to one, the demand is at unit elasticity | Rule of thumb for demand curves: slope is close to 0 = demand is elastic, slope is close to infinity = demand is inelastic | . . | . Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand . Total revenue: Price of a good * Quantity of good sold Graphical representation: | . | Total revenue is affected by elasticity An increase in price of an inelastic good increases revenue while an increase in price of an inelastic good decreases revenue | A unit elastic good will not experience a change in total revenue if the price changes | . | . Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve . Despite having a constant slope, a linear demand curve can have varying elasticities due to differences in percent change At high prices with low quantities, the curve is elastic, while at low prices with high quantities, the curve is inelastic | Graph and table: | Total revenue changes based on elasticities as well | . | . Other Demand Elasticities . The income elasticity of demand is the measure of how quantity demanded changes based on changes in income Formula: | Normal goods have positive income elasticities while inferior goods have negative ones | Engel’s Law stipulates: As a family’s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one. By contrast, luxuries such as jewelry and recreational goods tend to have large income elasticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their incomes are too low. | In other words, if an item makes up a small part of your income, the item is more inelastic because you can afford to pay the difference in price | . | The cross-price elasticity of demand is the measure of how the quantity demanded changes based on price changes of another good Formula: | Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities while complement goods have negative ones | . | . 5-2: The Elasticity of Supply . The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants . Price elasticity of supply: how much the quantity supplied changes due to a change in price Elastic goods have big changes in supply in response to changes in price, while inelastic goods do not | . | Elasticity depends on how easy it is for sellers to change the quantity supplied Beachfront land is inelastic (cannot create more) but manufactured goods are elastic | . | Key determinant of price elasticity of supply is time period Supply is more elastic in the long run vs. short run, as firms cannot change the size of factories easily in a short period of time | Other changes, such as closing and opening, make products more elastic | . | . Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply . Formula for price elasticity of supply is defined as: | . The Variety of Supply Curves . On a graph, a slope closer to infinity is inelastic while a slope closer to 0 is elastic | . . 5-3: Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity . Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers? . Scenario: you are a wehat farmer who spends time making your land as productive as possible | New strand of wheat is found that increases wheat production by 20% | Because wheat (food) is an inelastic good, the total revenue falls when the quantity sold increases Farmers lose money, but they must use the new strand in order to remain competitive with other farmers | . | Affect of advancements in farming can be seen in the vast decrease in workers in the farm industry | Negative effect on farmers still has a positive effect on society; food is cheaper, more workers to do other things | . Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High? . Scenario: OPEC raised the price of oil to increase income From 1973 to 1974, oil prices raised 50%, and they continued to rise | . | OPEC was unable to maintain a high price of oil, and it went back down to low prices during the 90s | Can be explained by elasticities Oil is inelastic, and short term prices rose because people needed to buy oil | In the long term, non-OPEC countries found different ways to produce oil and oil consumption was made more efficient | . | Short term cuts to supply can lead to short term gains but will lose money in the long run | . . Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease Drug-Related Crime? . Scenario: drug use is a serious problem, and the government tries to reduce the amount of drugs in the country | A raise in law enforcement for drugs reduces the quantity supplied for drugs Raises the price of drugs and reduces the quantity demanded for drugs | . | Demand for drugs remains inelastic (drug users will continue to want drugs), so drug users must pay more money for drugs which leads to crimes in order to obtain said money | Reducing demand for drugs can be more beneficial, as it will reduce both the price and quantity of drugs | Some argue that enforcing drug laws could be more beneficial to stopping drug crimes in the long run than in the short run, as goods become more elastic over time | . . Chapter 6: Supply, Demand, and Government Policies . 6-1: Controls on Prices . Different groups may want the equilibrium price of a good to go up or down based on their interests, and will lobby legislators to change the price Legislators can create a price ceiling (price maximum, favored by buyers) or price floor (price minimum, favored by suppliers) to make it so that the price can’t go beyond a certain range | . | . How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes . A price ceiling above the equilibrium price is not binding and has no effect on the price or quantity of ice cream | A price ceiling below the equilibrium price is a binding constraint and affects the good Leads to a shortage because there is too much demand but not enough supply | Due to the shortage of the good, sellers must ration their supply to buyers Includes imposing long lines or selling to favored groups (family, friends, racial/ethnic groups, etc.) | . | General rule: When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buyers | Binding constraints are undesirable because discrimination by seller bias is both inefficient and unfair | . | . . How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes . Binding price floors create a surplus of supply because the demand is too low for the supply Surplus of supply leads to further biases on the buyers’ side “Rationing” from buyers could include buying from sellers who are friends, family, of a certain race, etc. | . | . | Example: Increasing the minimum wage increases the supply of labor but decreases the demand for it, leading to more unemployment | . . Evaluating Price Controls . Economists dislike price controls because free markets tend to be the best way to organize economic activity Prices are the evolution of millions of decisions and settle at optimal values | . | The government can help to improve an economy, but setting price controls might hurt a group that they want to help A suggestion is to pay rent subsidies rather than create price controls | . | . 6-2: Taxes . Tax incidence: How taxes are distributed throughout a market | . How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers for each sale of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on sellers, the supply curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the input price is higher, the supply curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts upward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The supply curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The tax makes buyers worse off because they have to pay more for ice cream | The tax makes sellers worse off because, despite the increase in price, they lose 50 cents every sale | . | Taxes discourage market activity, decreasing the quantity sold of a good | Buyers and sellers both share the burden of taxes | Graph: | . How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes . Suppose a 50 cent tax was levied on sellers on each purchase of an ice cream cone | Step One Since the tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve is affected | . | Step Two Since the price is higher, the demand curve shifts to the left (specifically, the curve shifts downward by 50 cents) | . | Step Three The demand curve shifting to the left means that the price of ice cream went up (after adding the 50 cent tax) and the supply of ice cream went down, thus reducing the size of the market | . | Implications The effect of a tax on buyers and sellers are the same; the sellers sell for $2.80 and the buyers buy for $3.30, thus reducing the market for ice cream | 50 cents always goes to the government which is the reason for the similarity | . | Graph: | . Elasticity and Tax Incidence . Depending on elasticity, the tax incidence can vary greatly | Graph: | The more inelastic of supply/demand is the one who has the heavier tax burden (“A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic”) This is due to the ability/willingness of buyers/sellers to change the quantity demanded/supplied of a good | . | .",

            "content": "Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand . 4-1: Markets and Competition . What is a Market? . Market: The buyers and sellers of a good or service Buyers determine demand, sellers determine demand | Markets can be organized or disorganized Crop market is organized; sellers meet together and determine how much supply there is while buyers gather and auction for goods | Smaller, local markets (say, ice cream) are unorganized; ice cream stores are not in contact with each other and buyers don’t meet | . | . | . What is Competition? . Prices are determined by the entire market, as everyone is competing with each other | Competitive Market: A market with enough participants (buyers and sellers) that no one individual has a significant impact on the market For this chapter, markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive; all sold goods are exactly the same, and there are enough buyers and sellers that no one can influence the market heavily | Buyers and sellers are price takers; they can buy and sell as much as they want but only at the market price | Easy entry and exit from the industry in the long-run | . | Many markets are (nearly) perfectly competitive, but some have only one seller, leading to a monopoly | . 4-2: Demand . The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded . Quantity Demanded: The amount of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to purchase Many factors can affect quantity demanded, but the assumed, simplified market will focus on one: price | Law of Demand: Considering everything else equal, price and demand are inverse; when price rises, demand lowers, and vice versa | Graphical representation: | Above table is an example of a demand schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded | The graph shown is known as the demand curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded; typically slopes downwards | . | . Market Demand versus Individual Demand . Market Demand is the sum of all of the individual demands for a good or service Example of creating a market demand curve from two individual demand curves: | . | . Shifts in the Demand Curve . Income Lower income means that a demand curve falls, as there is less money to spend | Normal good: A good whose demand falls when income falls | Inferior good: A good whose demand increases when income falls (such as public transportation) | . | Prices of Related Goods Substitutes: Two or more goods that are similar enough to be affected by each otehrs prices If the cost of ice cream goes down, then the demand for frozen yogurt goes down too (because froyo is more expensive and fairly similar) | . | Complements: Two or more goods that will go up or down in demand together depending on their prices If the price of tapioca pearls lowers, then the demand for both pearls and tea will increase | . | . | Tastes Depending on your tastes, you may buy more or less of a good/service; hard to explain and unscientific | . | Expectations What you expect to happen can affect your behavior; if you think a disaster will occur, you’re more willing to buy more survival goods and less willing to buy unnecessary goods | . | Number of Buyers Adding buyers increases demand and lowering buyers decreases demand | . | . Additional Notes . The relationship between demand and quantity demanded is negative for two reasons Substitution effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers substitute it by buying similar products instead | Income effect: When the price of a good goes up, consumers’ purchasing power goes down, and the consumer buys less of the good but more of other goods | . | Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: The idea that each additional unit of a good that you receive becomes lower in value (or utility) as you receive more Indifference Curve: A curve showing the relationship between two goods that a consumer needs/likes; takes the shape of 1/x and is convex | . | . 4-3: Supply . The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied . Quantity Supplied: The amount of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell A big determinant is price; when price of ice cream is high, the quantity supplied increases (because sellers want to make a higher profit) and vice versa | Law of Supply: Considering everything else equal, price and supply are related; when price rises, supply increases, and vice versa | Graphical Representation: | Above table is an example of a supply schedule, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied | The graph shown is known as the supply curve which also shows the relationship between price and quantity supply; typically slopes upwards | . | . Market Supply versus Individual Supply . Market supply is the sum of all individual supplies | . Shifts in the Supply Curve . Input Prices The price of the inputs to make a good/service (ingredients, machinery, manpower) affects the quantity supplied | Increase in input price lowers quantity supplied and vice versa | . | Technology Advancements in technology increases the quantity supplied because it becomes cheaper/faster to produce | . | Expectations A firm that expects the popularity of a good/service to rise may produce more of it, and vice versa | If the price is expected to decrease, firms will supply more | . | Number of sellers More sellers = more quantity supplied, and vice versa | . | . 4-4: Supply and Demand Together . Equilibrium . When a supply curve and demand curve are graphed together, there is a singular point of interception That point is called the equilibrium, with the price representing the equilibrium price and the quantity representing the equilibrium quantity | Equilibrium point is in perfect balance; the quantity and price is the same that the buyers demand and the sellers supply | . | Naturally, prices and quantity move towards the equilibrium point If there is too much supply compared to demand, then there is a surplus and sellers cannot sell their goods at the current price Sellers have too much supply; begin to cut prices, thus increasing demand, lowering prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | If there is too much demand compared to supply, then there is a shortage and buyers cannot buy the goods they want due to a lack of availability Sellers are enabled to raise prices, thus lowering demand, increasing prices, and moving towards equilibrium | . | . | . . Theory of equilibrium leads to Law of Supply and Demand: the price of a good naturally adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance | . Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium . Must analyze events which affect equilibriums with three steps Does it change the supply curve, demand curve, or both? | Does it shift the curve to the left or right? | Compare the supply-and-demand diagrams to see how the shift affected the equilibrium point | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand One summer, it is more hot than usual Hot weather increases demand for ice cream but does not change supply curve | More demand shifts the demand curve to the right | Demand curve now meets the supply curve at a higher price and quantity | . | . | Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves In the last example, the actual supply curve didn’t move; instead, the equilibrium point moved upwards along the curve | A shift in the supply/demand curve is called a “change” while a movement along the supply/demand curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied/demanded” | . | Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply One summer, a hurricane destroys a sugarcane crop, increasing the price of sugar Raise in input costs leads to a reduction in the amount of ice cream produced | Less supply shifts the supply curve to the left | There is now a shortage of ice cream, and the equilibrium point moves left along the demand curve | . | . | Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand Let’s say that the hot weather and hurricane occurred in the same summer Both curves shift; the demand increases because of the heat, and the supply decreases because of a higher input cost | Demand curve shifts to the right, and supply curve shifts to the left | Depending on the size of the shifts, there are two possible outcomes, but both result in an increase in equilibrium price | . | . | . . Discussion Notes: Price typically falls on the y axis, and quantity falls on the x axis | Total revenue (p x q) follows a parabolic shape (goes up, plateaus, then goes down) | Elasticity: The change in price divided by the change in quantity; %deltaQ/%deltaP Typically calculated using derivatives, but can use a midpoint formula ∣Q2−Q1(Q1+Q2)/2P2−P1(P1+P2)/2∣| { {Q_2 - Q_1 over (Q_1 + Q_2) / 2} over {P_2 - P_1 over (P_1 + P_2) / 2} } |∣(P1​+P2​)/2P2​−P1​​(Q1​+Q2​)/2Q2​−Q1​​​∣ | . | Unit elastic is when your elasticity is equal to 1; over 1 is elastic, and under 1 is inelastic | Goods with substitutes are usually elastic, while necessities are inelastic | Decrease in price of an elastic good will increase revenue, while a decrease in price of an inelastic good will decrease revenue | . | . | Lecture Notes: Supply curves should start above (0, 0) because companies need to cover fixed costs | Regular equations for curves start with Q (Q = mP + b), but if P is on the left, then it is called inverse demand/supply | . | .",

When there are multiple variables in a predicate, you must use multiple, nested quantifiers Examples of nested quantifiers: | . | Propositions with multiple variables can be thought of as pairs Take ∀x ∀y M(x, y); this proposition is false if there is ANY pair of x, y that does not satisfy M(x, y) (including if x and y are the same) | For ∃x ∃y M(x, y), the proposition is false if ALL pairs of x, y are not true for M(x, y) (also including if x and y are the same) | . | If a quantified statement has two quantifiers (one existential (∃) and one universal (∀)), it’s effective to think of the statement as a two player game The existential player (variable) tries to make the expression true, while the universal player (variable) tries to make the expression false | The player (variable) on the left goes first, and the next player (variable) tries their best to succeed in their goal | Ex: In ∀x ∃y (x + y = 0), x goes first and chooses a random value; y tries its best to set x + y = 0 and is successful because it can always become -x | . | DeMorgan’s can be applied to nested quantifiers as well; it switches the signs of the quantifier to its opposite | . . . 1.10: More nested quantified statements . If you want to express ∀x ∀y without including situations where x == y, then you can write the proposition as ∀x ∀y ((x ≠ y) → M(x, y)) If x == y, then x, y cannot be used as a counter example because it’s not false | . | To express uniqueness, you can use a combination of nested quantifiers and conditionals | . . You can also move the quantifiers depending on where it is located in the statement | . . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.10.1 is good practice . . 1.11: Logical reasoning . Argument: A sequence of propsitions (AKA hypotheses) that is followed by a final proposition (AKA conclusion) Valid arguments have true conclusions when all hypotheses are true; invalid otherwise | ∴ symbol denotes “therefore” | Commutative law allows hypotheses to be in any order . | Ex: These two arguments are the same | Proving an arguments validity via truth table: . | You can prove that an argument is invalid by showing an example where the hypotheses are true but the conclusion is not | . | An argument’s form is found by replacing propositions with variables Ex: “It is raining today. + If it is raining today, I will not ride my bike to school. ∴ I will not ride my bike to school.” can be replaced with “p + (p –&gt; q) ∴ q” | Forms can be useful because it can invalidate an argument with known truth values Ex: | . | . | If an argument does not have an assignment where the hypotheses are true, then the argument is valid | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.11.1 is good practice . Questions: . What is the difference between (x != y) -&gt; and (x != y) ^? Is it because ^ is for existentials and -&gt; is for universals? .",

            "title": "Principles of Economics Ch. 1-3",
            "content": "Chapter 1: Ten Principles of Economics . By nature, resources are scarce, meaning that they are limited and not everyone can get whatever they want | Economics: study of how society manages its resources No one person controls all of the resources; every individual has a say in how a resource is distributed | Economists study how people make decisions based on resources (work, purchases, savings, etc.) | Economists also study larger forces/trends such as unemployment, income growth, inflation, etc. | . | . 1-1: How People Make Decisions . Summary: People make decisions based on what they have to give (opportunity cost) and comparing it to what they get. Rational people try to get the best outcome possible and use marginal changes to get the most out of their resources. Rational people also consider the costs and benefits of a purchase/behaving a certain way. . Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs . Most decisions require trade-offs; give something you like to get something you like | Types of trade-offs in society “Guns and butter”: The more spent on military/defense (guns), the less spent on quality of life goods (butter) Relates to trade-off between clean environment and high income; costs more for a factory to produce goods cleanly, so they might have to provide lower wages, charge higher prices, etc. | . | Efficiency and equality: getting the most out of a society’s resources vs. giving out products equally amongst members of the society (respectively) “Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices” | Efficiency and equality conflict with each other; giving poor people money (equality+) means that people may not work as hard and production goes down (efficiency-) | . | Trade-offs are key to understanding economics, as people try to make trade-offs most beneficial to them | . | . Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It . Opportunity cost: Everything you give up to get an item, including time, health, money, etc. Ex. Many athletes believe that spending 4 years in college has too high of an opportunity cost compared to going straight to a pro league | . | . Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin . Economy assumes people are rational, or that they try their hardest to get the best outcome | Decisions are not black and white (buy a 3m$ house or be homeless?), so rational people use marginal change to slowly adjust their plans in order to get the best result Marginal costs should be taken into account when making decisions | Ex. It’s free to watch another movie if you’ve already paid for a monthly subscription, or an airline can seat another person if they have empty seats; both marginal costs are zero | . | A classic example is “a cup of water vs. a diamond”; marginally, getting one more cup of water is much easier than getting a(nother) diamond, so water costs less | Rational decisions are ones where the marginal benefit (gaining one more unit) is greater than the marginal cost (how much does that extra unit cost?) | . Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives . Incentive: Something that encourages a person to act Ex. If apple prices rise, then consumers will buy fewer apples and producers will produce more apples | Public policymakers use incentives to affect the behaviors of citizens; taxing cigarettes causes less people to smoke | Incentives often affect cost-benefit calculations and must be taken into consideration | . | . 1-2: How People Interact . Summary: People trade in order to maximize their production, as trade allows for specialization. Markets facilitate trade, and governments often step in to ensure that the market runs smoothly. . Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off . Competition and trading can benefit all parties Each person trades goods (work, most commonly) for other goods (food, homes, cars, etc.); competitive pricing forces goods to have low prices, benefiting consumers | Not participating in trade/competition means that people would have to grow their own food, build their own house, etc. | Trading allows for specialization and more advanced societies | . | . Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity . Communism was founded on principle that the government should control the economy (central planning) AKA Command Economy | Most countries that had central planning stopped using it in favor of a market economy | Government decides on the producers, the level of output, the consumers; pretty much everything | . | Market Economy: an economy that is based on the decisions of individual households, companies, firms, etc. to exchange goods and services; decisions are made based on whatever is the most profitable/whatever provides the best outcome Can seem dangerous (no governing authority to ensure equality), but people make decisions as if guided by “an invisible hand (Adam Smith) | Prices are the main way the economy is controlled; determines the demand from buyers and the supply from sellers, thus displaying the value of a product to society | When a government interrupts the forces of natural supply and demand, the decisions of individuals don’t follow the invisible hand as much Shows why communism failed: prices didn’t change to reflect the true values of products | Leads to excesses and shortages because the government doesn’t know how much demand there is | . | Products such as Uber show the inner workings of market economies | . | . Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes . Governments are necessary to enforce rules that are important to a market economy These rules include property rights; individuals must be able to own and control their resources freely | . | Governments also choose whether or not to promote efficiency or equality Occasionally, a market failure occurs where a free market is inefficient in its distribution of resources; government must step in to make it efficient Can be caused by externality: the actions of one affects the health/well-being of another (such as pollution) Can negatively or positively affect consumption and production | Examples include smoking cigarettes, pollution, education, or a bee farm next to an orange orchard | . | Can also be caused by market power: one (or a few) person(s) or group(s) control a resource and can unnaturally change its price due to its necessity | Asymmetric Information: one party has more information than another; can lie and be dishonest with a price Adverse Selection: Market failure where products of lower quality are sold at the same price as those of higher quality; too many low quality products are sold | Moral Hazard: When a party can change their behavior without taking on risk, typically in the form of insurance | . | . | Free markets can cause large wealth disparities and inequalities; government can step in and provide basic goods + welfare for those at the bottom of the economic ladder | . | Public policy not always perfect; can be corrupted or abused | . 1-3: How the Economy as a Whole Works . Summary: Countries that are able to produce more goods and services have a higher standard of living. Printing can stimulate an economy, leading to the hiring of more workers, but it can also lead to higher inflation. Often, printing money (or the lack thereof) causes random business cycles. . Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services . Different countries have different qualities of life and average incomes; higher income == higher quality of life This difference relies on a countries’ productivity, or the goods/services output per unit of work input | Countries with higher productivities generally have a higher standard of living than countries with lower productivities This relationship means that other factors are far less important in determining standard of living | . | Policy makers must create policy based on increasing productivity | . | . Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money . Inflation: A rise in prices across an economy Inflation typically occurs because governments print money; more money –&gt; money is less valuable –&gt; prices increase | . | . Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment . Printing money stimulates the economy, causes companies to hire more people, and increases production BUT it causes higher prices in the long term Leads to business cycles: large, irregular, and unpredictable changes in economic activity | Government spending, printing, and taxing can all affect inflation, productivity, and more - it’s up for debate how much (if at all) the government should do | . | . . Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist . 2-1: The Economist as Scientist . Summary: Economists can act as a scientist in the sense that they create hypotheses in order to understand more about the field. They must make assumptions in order to form these hypotheses/conclusions. There are many models to represent an economy. There are two studies of economics: micro and macro. . The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation . Newton first observed an apple fall, created a theory about gravity, and observed to see if his theory was correct; this method can be applied to economics Ex. An economist could theorize that inflation and high prices were related, then gather data from countries and see if his theory is correct | . | Difference between traditional sciences and economics is that economics cannot create controlled experiments; they must make do with real world data Historical events often provide the best study cases for how a key resource affects an economy, such as wars in the Middle East | . | . The Role of Assumptions . Economists must make assumptions in order to simplify complex situations and clarify them Ex. Breaking down a complicated problem (analyzing international trade) into smaller parts (analyze trade between two countries and with two products) to better understand the concepts | . | The elegance of economics is deciding what assumptions to use Ex. When studying effects of inflation on price, you could assume that short term prices will stay similar while long term prices will fluctuate greatly | . | . Economic Models . Models often omit details to show what is really important and are built with assumptions | . Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram . Circular-flow diagram is used to show how groups in an economy interact with each other | In the diagram, households (consumers) and firms (producers) participate in two markets Markets for goods and services are ones where households buy the products of firms | Markets for the factors of production are ones where households provide input (labor, money, etc.) to firms for the firms to create goods and services | . | Inner loop represents the flow of inputs (labor, land, capital) and outputs (goods and services) | Outer loop represents the flow of dollars/money; paying wages, buying goods, etc. | Circular-flow diagram is good to understand how different parts of the economy interact | Assumed that there is no government intervention, foreign trade | . Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier . Most economic models are built using mathematics | The production possibilities frontier is a graph that displays the different levels of output for two goods (assuming that an economy only produces those two goods) | The outermost line represents the maximum efficiency of the economy (efficient combinations lie on this line); can only produce that many products given its resources Any points outside of the border (such as point C) cannot be reached in the current state of the economy | Any points inside of the border but not on the line (such as point D) are deemd inefficient because they don’t use the maximum amount of resources | . | The graph relates to both trade-offs and opportunity costs Trade-off between producing more/less of one product than the other | Opportunity cost is depends on the slope of the frontier; lower slope = lower opportunity cost, steeper slope = higher opportunity cost | . | Econoomists believe that production possibilities frontiers will generally have a curved shape Ex. If all of an economy’s resources (including car makers) are being used to make computers, then making one car will barely inhibit computer production and vice verse; leads to different slopes at the ends | . | Frontiers can shift depending on economic growth or change | The frontier establishes scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and growth; good model for demonstrating economics | . Microeconomics and Macroeconomics . Microeconomics: The study of how households and firms interact with each other and make decisions on a small scale (in one market, for example) | Macroeconomics: The study of how things can affect an entire economy | Both are tied to each other; impossible to understand macroeconomic concepts without knowing microeconomic ones Both fields are still very different, warranting different courses | . | . 2-2: The Economist as Policy Advisor . Summary: Economists can make either positive or normative statements. Policymakers listen to these statements and form laws based on the advice, though economists are not always listened to. . Positive versus Normative Analysis . A positive statement is objective and makes a statement about how the world is | A normative statement is subjective and makes a statement about how the world should be | Positive statements can be analyzed, rationed with, and (dis)proven, while normative statements must be evaluated using both facts and moral values | . Economists in Washington . Economists must describe both options to policy makers in order for them to make a well-informed decision | Economists give advice, formulate plans, design tax policy, analyze data, evalutate public policy, provide new insight through research and publications, and more | . Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed . Economic policy, in practice, cannot be enforced as it would be in theory | Lawmakers must appeal to the masses (as well as Congress) and change portions of suggested economic policy in order to do so | . 2-3: Why Economists Disagree . Summary: Economists disagree on issues because they have different values and may interpret data differently. However, there are many “controversial” issues that economists typically agree on. . Differences in Scientific Judgments . Economists are always trying to understand world economies, so they might disagree if they interpret certain discoveries differently This includes controversial concepts like supply-side economics and welfare | . | . Differences in Values . Economists may disagree on the “fairness” of policies based on their values or upbringings | . Perception versus Reality . Economists agree on many propositions that may be more controversial to the public, such as rent control and enforcing tariffs Despite the fact that economists agree, if politicans were to implement such policies (like rent control), they might not get reelected/lose popularity, thus causing contradictions between public policy and agreed upon propositions | . | . . Chapter 3: Interdependence and the Gains from Trade . 3-1: A Parable for the Modern Economy . Summary: Trade can benefit both parties even if one party is absolutely better than the other at producing a certain good. Trade allows for specialization. . Scenario: Let’s say there are two people, Ruby and Frank, and two goods, beef and potatoes Ruby can only produce beef and Frank can only produce potatoes | Both parties would benefit from trading with each other, as they would have more variety in their diets (beef + potatoes vs. only beef or only potatoes) | Can also trade other things; if Ruby can’t farm potatoes well and Frank can’t raise cattle, then they could trade farms | . | Guiding Question: What if one person is better at producing every good? | . Production Possibilities . Assuming that Frank and Ruby could work 8 hours a day, they can only devote so much time to raising cattle or growing potatoes | Production possibilities frontier for both farmers: These frontiers are not curved (or “bowed-out”) because each farmer’s efficiency remains the same regardless the amount of time spent on either task | . | The frontiers show us what would happen if both farmers were self sufficient and are good at displaying the trade-offs they make, but aren’t effective at showing what decisions they would make | . Specialization and Trade . Ruby tells Frank to spend all of his time farming potatoes (which he is more efficient at) | Ruby spends more of her time farming cattle (which she is better at than Frank) and some of her time growing potatoes | By specializing and trading their specialized goods, both farmers benefit and consume more of both foods | . 3-2: Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization** . Summary: Comparative advantage determines how trade is conducted; if both parties have a comparative advantage over one another, then they can export the good that they are more efficient in producing. For both parties to benefit, the price of trade should be between their opportunity costs. . Absolute Advantage . Absolute advantage is used to compare two firms, countries, people, etc.; one group has an absolute advantage if they use less inputs for the same output Ruby takes 20 minutes to make an ounce of meat and 10 minutes to make an ounce of potatoes, while Frank takes 60 and 15 minutes, respectively; Ruby has an absolute advantage over Frank | . | . Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage . In this scenario, opportunity cost represents the trade-off in time between producing meat and potatoes Ruby can make 2 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; her opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/2 ounce of meat | Frank can make 4 ounces of potatoes in the time it takes to make 1 ounce of meat; his opportunity cost for 1 ounce of potatoes is 1/4 ounce of meat | . | Comparative advantage: Having a lower opportunity cost to produce a good compared to another producer Despite Frank being worse at producing both goods, he has a comparative advantage over Ruby because 1/4 &lt; 1/2 | One person cannot have a comparative advantage in both goods because the comparative advantages are inverse; if you have a low opportunity cost for one good, it’ll be higher for the other good | . | . Comparative Advantage and Trade . When people specialize in producing a good that they have a comparative advantage in, the total production of the economy rises, making everyone better off | By trading, people can obtain goods at a lower opportunity cost and therefore get more net goods | . The Price of Trade . To determine the price at which parties trade at, a general rule can be applied: For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between their opportunity costs Frank and Ruby trade at a price of 3 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat; Ruby’s opportunity cost is 2 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat and Frank’s is 4 ounces of potatoes for 1 ounce of meat | Any price between 2 and 4 would benefit both parties If below 2, then both parties would want to buy meat because it’s cheaper than their opportunity cost; if above 4, then both parties would want to sell meat because the price is higher than their opportunity cost | . | . | . 3-3: Applications of Comparative Advantage . Summary: Examples of how comparative advantages apply to the real world. . Should LeBron James Mow His Own Lawn? . James is a great athlete, but the time he wastes on mowing his lawn could be used on other things such as recording a commercial or otherwise Regular people have a comparative advantage over James, so James should hire people to mow his lawn for him (and compensate them at a price that is higher than their opportunity cost) | . | . Should the United States Trade with Other Countries? . Goods bought from abroad are called imports and goods sold to other countries are exports | If one country is more adept at producing a certain good compared to another country, then they should export that good while importing a good that said other country has a comparative advantage in | Trade can benefit both parties, but it may hurt individuals; importing cars and exporting farmed goods affects autoworkers and farmers differently | .",

            "content": "1.1: Propositions and logical operations . Proposition: A statement that is either true or false Does not include commands (Shut the door!) or questions (What time is it?) | Propositions have a truth value, can be either: true, false, unknown, or a matter of opinion | . | A compound proposition is the combination of propositions using a logical operator ∧ represents “and”; p ∧ q is true if both p and q are true AKA conjunction operator | Truth table: | . | ∨ represents “or”; p ∨ q is true if either p or q are true AKA disjunction operator | Truth Table: | . | In English, “or” is typically used to represent “either/or”, or exclusive or (represented by ⊕), where both conditions cannot be true at the same time (She is eating or running) Only difference is that T ⊕ T == F while T ∨ T == T | ∨ represents inclusive or where both conditions CAN be true at the same time | . | ¬ represents negation, or NOT; ¬True == False and ¬False == True | . | . . 1.2 Evaluating compound propositions . Compound propositions can have more than one operation Order of operations w/o parantheses: ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or) | Good practice to use parantheses | . | Truth tables will contain 2n rows for n variables(2 options for each variable) | Rightmost variable is filled in with TFTF…, leftmost is filled in with TTFF…; T and F alternates based on 2column number where rightmost column = 1 | . | Example of a truth table with intermediate steps: | . . 1.3 Conditional statements . Conditional operations are represented with the symbol → p → q is read as “if p then q” | Truth table: | Think of it as a contract; if condition one is fulfilled, then the second condition HAS to be fulfilled, but if condition one is not fulfilled, then the second condition can either be fulfilled or not. | Different ways to express conditional operations: | p only if q is also p → q; most confusing one | . | Related conditional statements include the contrapositive, converse, and inverse The converse of p → q is q → p | The contrapositive of p → q is ¬q → ¬p | The inverse of p → q is ¬p → ¬q | . | Biconditional operations are represented with ↔ p ↔ q stands for “p if and only if q” - AKA true if p == q and false if not | If and only if can be represented with iff | . | Conditional and biconditional operations can be used in conjunction with other operations ∧, ∨, and ¬ takes precedence before → or ↔ | . | . . 1.4 Logical equivalence . A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, while a contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false p ∨ ¬p is a tautology, while p ∧ ¬p is a contradiction | . | Logical equivalence means that two compound propositions always return the same value ≡ is used to denote logical equivalence | If s ≡ r, then s ↔ r is a tautology, and s ≡ r if and only if r ≡ s | . | De Morgan’s Laws are laws that use logical equivalences to show how to distribute negation, or NOT, operations First version of the law: ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q) or !(p or q) == !p and !q | Second version of the law: ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) or !(p and q) == !p or !q | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activity 1.4.1 is a great capstone activity for practice . . 1.5 Laws of propositional logic . You can substitute a proposition in for another one if both propositions are logically equivalent ex: Because p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q, (p ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ≡ (p ∨ r) ∧ (p → q) | Useful laws for logical equivalence: | . | . NOTE TO SELF: Challenge activities 1.5.1-1.5.3 are great practice activities .",
