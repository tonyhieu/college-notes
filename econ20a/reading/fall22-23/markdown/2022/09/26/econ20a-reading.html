    <h2 id="chapter-1-ten-principles-of-economics">Chapter 1: Ten Principles of Economics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>By nature, resources are <strong>scarce</strong>, meaning that they are limited and not everyone can get whatever they want</li>
  <li><strong>Economics</strong>: study of how society manages its resources
    <ul>
      <li>No one person controls all of the resources; every individual has a say in how a resource is distributed</li>
      <li>Economists study how people make decisions based on resources (work, purchases, savings, etc.)</li>
      <li>Economists also study larger forces/trends such as unemployment, income growth, inflation, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-1-how-people-make-decisions">1-1: How People Make Decisions</h3>

<p><strong>Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Most decisions require trade-offs; give something you like to get something you like</li>
  <li>Types of trade-offs in society
    <ul>
      <li>“Guns and butter”: The more spent on military/defense (guns), the less spent on quality of life goods (butter)
        <ul>
          <li>Relates to trade-off between clean environment and high income; costs more for a factory to produce goods cleanly, so they might have to provide lower wages, charge higher prices, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> and <strong>equality</strong>: getting the most out of a society’s resources vs. giving out products equally amongst members of the society (respectively)
        <ul>
          <li>“Efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to how the pie is divided into individual slices”</li>
          <li>Efficiency and equality conflict with each other; giving poor people money (equality+) means that people may not work as hard and production goes down (efficiency-)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Trade-offs are key to understanding economics, as people try to make trade-offs most beneficial to them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opportunity cost</strong>: Everything you give up to get an item, including time, health, money, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. Many athletes believe that spending 4 years in college has too high of an opportunity cost compared to going straight to a pro league</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economy assumes people are <strong>rational</strong>, or that they try their hardest to get the best outcome</li>
  <li>Decisions are not black and white (buy a 3m$ house or be homeless?), so rational people use <strong>marginal change</strong> to slowly adjust their plans in order to get the best result
    <ul>
      <li><u>Marginal costs</u> should be taken into account when making decisions</li>
      <li>Ex. It’s free to watch another movie if you’ve already paid for a monthly subscription, or an airline can seat another person if they have empty seats; both marginal costs are zero</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A classic example is “a cup of water vs. a diamond”; marginally, getting one more cup of water is much easier than getting a(nother) diamond, so water costs less</li>
  <li>Rational decisions are ones where the marginal benefit (gaining one more unit) is greater than the marginal cost (how much does that extra unit cost?)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incentive</strong>: Something that encourages a person to act
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. If apple prices rise, then consumers will buy fewer apples and producers will produce more apples</li>
      <li>Public policymakers use incentives to affect the behaviors of citizens; taxing cigarettes causes less people to smoke</li>
      <li>Incentives often affect cost-benefit calculations and must be taken into consideration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-2-how-people-interact">1-2: How People Interact</h3>

<p><strong>Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Competition and trading can benefit all parties
    <ul>
      <li>Each person trades goods (work, most commonly) for other goods (food, homes, cars, etc.); competitive pricing forces goods to have low prices, benefiting consumers</li>
      <li>Not participating in trade/competition means that people would have to grow their own food, build their own house, etc.</li>
      <li>Trading allows for specialization and more advanced societies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Communism was founded on principle that the government should control the economy (central planning)
    <ul>
      <li>Most countries that had central planning stopped using it in favor of a market economy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Market Economy</strong>: an economy that is based on the decisions of individual households, companies, firms, etc. to exchange goods and services; decisions are made based on whatever is the most profitable/whatever provides the best outcome
    <ul>
      <li>Can seem dangerous (no governing authority to ensure equality), but people make decisions as if guided by “an invisible hand) (Adam Smith)</li>
      <li>Prices are the main way the economy is controlled; determines the demand from buyers and the supply from sellers, thus displaying the value of a product to society</li>
      <li>When a government interrupts the forces of natural supply and demand, the decisions of individuals don’t follow the invisible hand as much
        <ul>
          <li>Shows why communism failed: prices didn’t change to reflect the true values of products</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Products such as Uber show the inner workings of market economies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Governments are necessary to enforce rules that are important to a market economy
    <ul>
      <li>These rules include <strong>property rights</strong>; individuals must be able to own and control their resources freely</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Governments also choose whether or not to promote efficiency or equality
    <ul>
      <li>Occasionally,  a <strong>market failure</strong> occurs where a free market is inefficient in its distribution of resources; government must step in to make it efficient
        <ul>
          <li>Can be caused by <strong>externality</strong>: the actions of one affects the health/well-being of another (such as pollution)</li>
          <li>Can also be caused by <strong>market power</strong>: one (or a few) person(s) or group(s) control a resource and can unnaturally change its price due to its necessity</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Free markets can cause large wealth disparities and inequalities; government can step in and provide basic goods + welfare for those at the bottom of the economic ladder</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Public policy not always perfect; can be corrupted or abused</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-3-how-the-economy-as-a-whole-works">1-3: How the Economy as a Whole Works</h3>

<p><strong>Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Different countries have different qualities of life and average incomes; higher income == higher quality of life
    <ul>
      <li>This difference relies on a countries’ <strong>productivity</strong>, or the goods/services output per unit of work input</li>
      <li>Countries with higher productivities generally have a higher standard of living than countries with lower productivities
        <ul>
          <li>This relationship means that other factors are far less important in determining standard of living</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Policy makers must create policy based on increasing productivity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inflation</strong>: A rise in prices across an economy
    <ul>
      <li>Inflation typically occurs because governments print money; more money –&gt; money is less valuable –&gt; prices increase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Printing money stimulates the economy, causes companies to hire more people, and increases production BUT it causes higher prices in the long term
    <ul>
      <li>Leads to <strong>business cycles</strong>: large, irregular, and unpredictable changes in economic activity</li>
      <li>Government spending, printing, and taxing can all affect inflation, productivity, and more - it’s up for debate how much (if at all) the government should do</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-2-thinking-like-an-economist">Chapter 2: Thinking Like an Economist</h2>

<h3 id="2-1-the-economist-as-scientist">2-1: The Economist as Scientist</h3>

<p><strong>The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Newton first observed an apple fall, created a theory about gravity, and observed to see if his theory was correct; this method can be applied to economics
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. An economist could theorize that inflation and high prices were related, then gather data from countries and see if his theory is correct</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Difference between traditional sciences and economics is that economics cannot create controlled experiments; they must make do with real world data
    <ul>
      <li>Historical events often provide the best study cases for how a key resource affects an economy, such as wars in the Middle East</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Role of Assumptions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economists must make assumptions in order to simplify complex situations and clarify them
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. Breaking down a complicated problem (analyzing international trade) into smaller parts (analyze trade between two countries and with two products) to better understand the concepts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The elegance of economics is deciding what assumptions to use
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. When studying effects of inflation on price, you could assume that short term prices will stay similar while long term prices will fluctuate greatly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Economic Models</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Models often omit details to show what is really important and are built with assumptions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Circular-flow diagram</strong> is used to show how groups in an economy interact with each other
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/192471215-31543ee1-7cb9-4bb4-bcc3-5d17df16b570.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 1 12 05 AM" /></li>
  <li>In the diagram, households (consumers) and firms (producers) participate in two markets
    <ul>
      <li><u>Markets for goods and services</u> are ones where households buy the products of firms</li>
      <li><u>Markets for the factors of production</u> are ones where households provide input (labor, money, etc.) to firms for the firms to create goods and services</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inner loop represents the flow of inputs (labor, land, capital) and outputs (goods and services)</li>
  <li>Outer loop represents the flow of dollars/money; paying wages, buying goods, etc.</li>
  <li>Circular-flow diagram is good to understand how different parts of the economy interact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Most economic models are built using mathematics</li>
  <li>The <strong>production possibilities frontier</strong> is a graph that displays the different levels of output for two goods (assuming that an economy only produces those two goods)
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/192474136-560a1f9c-7358-4eb7-8ff5-4676ee9518e2.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 1 25 29 AM" /></li>
  <li>The outermost line represents the maximum efficiency of the economy (<em>efficient</em> combinations lie on this line); can only produce that many products given its resources
    <ul>
      <li>Any points outside of the border (such as point C) cannot be reached in the current state of the economy</li>
      <li>Any points inside of the border but not on the line (such as point D) are deemd <em>inefficient</em> because they don’t use the maximum amount of resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The graph relates to both <u>trade-offs</u> and <u>opportunity costs</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Trade-off between producing more/less of one product than the other</li>
      <li>Opportunity cost is depends on the slope of the frontier; lower slope = lower opportunity cost, steeper slope = higher opportunity cost</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Econoomists believe that production possibilities frontiers will generally have a curved shape
    <ul>
      <li>Ex. If all of an economy’s resources (including car makers) are being used to make computers, then making one car will barely inhibit computer production and vice verse; leads to different slopes at the ends</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frontiers can shift depending on economic growth or change
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/192476984-31d81b32-eb39-4290-8a50-88c9ca9b152a.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 1 38 03 AM" /></li>
  <li>The frontier establishes scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity cost, and growth; good model for demonstrating economics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Microeconomics and Macroeconomics</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Microeconomics</strong>: The study of how households and firms interact with each other and make decisions on a small scale (in one market, for example)</li>
  <li><strong>Macroeconomics</strong>: The study of how things can affect an entire economy</li>
  <li>Both are tied to each other; impossible to understand macroeconomic concepts without knowing microeconomic ones
    <ul>
      <li>Both fields are still very different, warranting different courses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-2-the-economist-as-policy-advisor">2-2: The Economist as Policy Advisor</h3>

<p><strong>Positive versus Normative Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>positive statement</strong> is objective and makes a statement about how the world <em>is</em></li>
  <li>A <strong>normative statement</strong> is subjective and makes a statement about how the world <em>should be</em></li>
  <li>Positive statements can be analyzed, rationed with, and (dis)proven, while normative statements must be evaluated using both facts and moral values</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Economists in Washington</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economists must describe both options to policy makers in order for them to make a well-informed decision</li>
  <li>Economists give advice, formulate plans, design tax policy, analyze data, evalutate public policy, provide new insight through research and publications, and more</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economic policy, in practice, cannot be enforced as it would be in theory</li>
  <li>Lawmakers must appeal to the masses (as well as Congress) and change portions of suggested economic policy in order to do so</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-3-why-economists-disagree">2-3: Why Economists Disagree</h3>

<p><strong>Differences in Scientific Judgments</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economists are always trying to understand world economies, so they might disagree if they interpret certain discoveries differently
    <ul>
      <li>This includes controversial concepts like supply-side economics and welfare</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Differences in Values</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economists may disagree on the “fairness” of policies based on their values or upbringings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Perception versus Reality</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Economists agree on many propositions that may be more controversial to the public, such as rent control and enforcing tariffs
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/192480951-ab3b698e-8ed5-4502-a8b8-8932ea162ca4.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 1 54 25 AM" />
    <ul>
      <li>Despite the fact that economists agree, if politicans were to implement such policies (like rent control), they might not get reelected/lose popularity, thus causing contradictions between public policy and agreed upon propositions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
