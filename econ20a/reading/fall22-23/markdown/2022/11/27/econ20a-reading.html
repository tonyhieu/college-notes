<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Monopoly</strong>: A firm that is the sole seller of its product which has no close substitutes
    <ul>
      <li>Caused by a <em>barrier to entry</em>; other firms cannot enter the market and compete</li>
      <li>Three main barriers to entry: monopoly resources, government regulation, and production process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monopoly Resources</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A monopoly can arise if a firm has sole access to a key resource
    <ul>
      <li>For example, a small town might only have one well; the owner of said well has a monopoly</li>
      <li>Famous example is DeBeers, a diamond company that controls 80% of diamonds produced</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Monopolies rarely arise because of access to a key resource, as most resources are freely available</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Government-Created Monopolies</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Monopolies can arise when the government provides one person or firm the sole ability to sell a product
    <ul>
      <li>The two most important ways the government does so is through <em>patent</em> and <em>copyright</em> laws</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Though the laws create a monopoly which is undesirable compared to a competitive market, they also encourage research and development</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Natural Monopolies</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>natural monopoly</strong> occurs when a single firm can supply a good or service at a lower cost than two (or more) other firms combined
    <ul>
      <li>Naturally monopolistic companies have constant economies of scale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industries with natural monopolies are hard to enter; new firms cannot produce at as low of a price and compete</li>
  <li>Smaller markets are more condusive to natural monopolies, as the profit from competing with existing firms has a lower potential</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monopoly versus Competition</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The key difference between competitive firms and monopolies is that monopolies can control the price of the output while competitives firms (price takers) cannot
    <ul>
      <li>The demand curve for a competitive firm is elastic, as they can produce any quantity and have people buy at that price</li>
      <li>The demand curve for a monopoly slopes downward, as higher quantities induce lower prices and vice versa</li>
      <li>Figure: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204200418-5e8ff63a-4290-4798-854f-5b5845198895.png" alt="image">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Monopoly’s Revenue</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider a water producer with the following statistics: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204200638-f6b526db-f50d-412f-9206-86db37eb2014.png" alt="image">
    <ul>
      <li>Note that the <em>marginal revenue is always less than the price of the good</em>
        <ul>
          <li>This is because monopolists lose money on earlier sales while gaining revenue at the new price</li>
          <li>When you go from a quantity of 3 to 4, your price drops by a dollar; you lose $3 on the original quantity while increasing revenue by the price * one unit</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two effects on total revenue (P x Q):
    <ul>
      <li>
<em>The output effect</em>: More output is sold, so Q is higher and the total revenue increases</li>
      <li>
<em>The price effect</em>: The price is lower, so P is lower and the total revenue decreases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Marginal revenue is positive when the output effect outweighs the price effect but is negative when the price effect outweighs the output effect</li>
  <li>Graph of Demand Marginal Revenue Curves: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204201505-9f11a95f-e580-4e3f-96ee-55e76dea0532.png" alt="image">
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Profit Maximization</strong></p>

<p>Graph of relevant curves for a monopoly: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204201621-fbf00bff-d5ff-4afc-955c-ab7ca65c9cc9.png" alt="image"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Similar to competitive firms, monopolies choose the level of production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost
    <ul>
      <li>Low quantity = lower marginal cost = increase quantity produced</li>
      <li>High quantity = high marginal cost = decrease quantity produced</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unlike competitive firms, the marginal revenue is always lower than the price
    <ul>
      <li>Competitive firms: P = MR = MC</li>
      <li>Monopolies: P &gt; MR = MC</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Therefore, to choose the price of the product, monopolies create the quantity at which MR = MC and determine the price using the demand curve</li>
  <li>Because the price is greater than the marginal cost for monopolies, a social cost is created</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Monopoly’s Profit</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Similar to competitive firms:
    <ul>
      <li>Profit (P) = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC)</li>
      <li>P = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q</li>
      <li>P = (Price - ATC) * Q</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Graph that shows a monopoly’s profit: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204202583-5ad45ae6-6fff-45fe-bdb3-61005b1f7b83.png" alt="image">
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Main Steps to Maximize a Monopoly’s Profit</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Derive the MR curve using the demand curve</li>
  <li>Find the quantity at which MR = MC</li>
  <li>On the demand curve, find the price that matches the quantity</li>
  <li>If the price is greater than the average total cost, the monopoly profits</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Deadweight Loss</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The quantity the maximizes total surplus is the found at the intersection of the supply curve (or marginal cost curve) and the demand curve
    <ul>
      <li>Figure: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204220562-1ba17cb0-a040-480c-a748-dcf5ba937138.png" alt="image">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The quantity that the monopolist chooses is the one that maximizes profit which is at the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost
    <ul>
      <li>Recall that marginal revenue is always lower than price (or demand)</li>
      <li>Thus, <em>monopolies produce lower than the efficient quantity.</em>
</li>
      <li>This causes a deadweight loss because some consumers might value the price above the monopoly’s cost but below its price</li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204220814-5c13db3b-2ecb-45be-b2cf-8454da6eb6f4.png" alt="image">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The deadweight loss caused by monopolies is similar to a tax; it drives a wedge between supply and demand
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of creating revenue for the government, it creates revenue for the monopoly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The fact that the firm profits does not mean that there is a social cost; it simply means that producers benefit more than consumers
    <ul>
      <li>However, because monopolies produce less than is efficient, there is a social cost</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is a caveat to this: if monopolies use their profits to maintain their monopoly, then all producer surplus is lost and the deadweight loss grows bigger</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="15-4-price-discrimination">
<a class="anchor" href="#15-4-price-discrimination" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>15-4: Price Discrimination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Price discrimination</strong>: Selling the same good at different prices to different customers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Parable about Pricing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If one party values a good more than another party, then a monopoly would want to try to sell their product at a higher price to the party that values it more
    <ul>
      <li>This eliminates deadweight loss, as parties unwilling to buy a good at a higher price will buy the good at a lower one</li>
      <li>Increasing the amount sold is equivalent to increasing the quantity; the inefficiency of monopolies is lessened because they produce more</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Moral of the Story</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Price discrimination is a rational decision to maximize profit</li>
  <li>To price discriminate, firms must be able to separate customers by their willingness to pay (either by geography, method of buying, etc.)
    <ul>
      <li>Adding on to this, there must be some measure in place to prevent <em>arbitrage</em>, or buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another at a higher price</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Price discrimination can raise economic welfare, as more consumers purchase the product
    <ul>
      <li>Note that all increases in surplus are producer-side; they make more profit while consumers purchase goods at their willingness to buy (resulting in zero consumer surplus)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Analytics of Price Discrimination</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<em>Perfect price discrimination</em> is when a monopolist knows each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge them accordingly
    <ul>
      <li>Assuming the monopolist can perfectly price discriminate, the following graphs can be made: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204230280-72a6d7b0-7633-4790-8295-827d11d9a8f7.png" alt="image">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All marginal consumers get the product at their value, and the monopoly pockets all surplus</li>
  <li>Imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or not affect the total surplus in a market
    <ul>
      <li>All that is certain is that price discrimination increases the monopoly’s profit, as firms would only price discriminate if there was a benefit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of Price Discrimination</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Movie Tickets - Though the marginal cost of selling a theater seat is constant, there are discounts for kids and seniors</li>
  <li>Airline Prices - Depending on the timing of your flight, you might be charged more because you are a businessperson and value a flight more</li>
  <li>Discount Coupons - Richer people won’t use coupons and stores can make a bigger profit off of them because of that</li>
  <li>Financial Aid - Wealthy families have a higher willingness to pay and thus don’t receive aid so the college can make the most money</li>
  <li>Quantity Discounts - The more of a good you purchase, the lower your marginal willingness to pay is, so stores sell in bulk</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#15-5-public-policy-towards-monopolies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>15-5: Public Policy Towards Monopolies</h3>

<p><strong>Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If two big companies wish to merge, then the Department of Justice analyzes the deal before approving, as the union of two big companies could result in a monopoly
    <ul>
      <li>Horizontal merges are typically blocked, as they remove all competition</li>
      <li>Vertical merges are allowed because it doesn’t remove competition; it just makes one firm more efficient</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Laws such as the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts allow the government to prevent mergers</li>
  <li>Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, but mergers can also create more efficient methods of production
    <ul>
      <li>It’s up to the government to decide if a merger is beneficial or not, and critics question the government’s decisionmaking abilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Regulation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Governments regulate the behaviors (typically through pricing) of monopolies, usually focusing on natural monopolies like water or electricity</li>
  <li>The price the government sets is difficult to determine
    <ul>
      <li>A low price could cause the firm to incur a loss, forcing them to exit the industry</li>
      <li>A high price (that results in zero economic profit) might not be the profit maximizing quantity for a firm, causing a deadweight loss</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A regulated price also gives the monopolist no incentive to lower their costs, as they can’t make a higher profit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Public Ownership</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Governments have the option to run a natural monopoly itself
    <ul>
      <li>Common in European countries where the government owns telephone, water, and electric companies</li>
      <li>The US runs the Postal Service</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Private monopolies are preferred to public monopolies, as private ones have an incentive to lower costs and become more efficient while public ones are slowed by the bureaucracy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Doing Nothing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Policies aimed at reducing monopolies have drawbacks, and some economists argue that it is most efficient to allow monopolies to flourish</li>
</ul>
