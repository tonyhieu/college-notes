<p><strong>Willingness to pay</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Willingness to pay</strong>: The maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good; represents what a buyer values a good at</li>
  <li>Consider the following scenario where four people want to buy an album:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Buyer</th>
      <th>Willingness to Pay</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Taylor</td>
      <td>100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Carrie</td>
      <td>80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rihanna</td>
      <td>70</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gaga</td>
      <td>50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>In an auction, the price would raise to 80$, and Taylor would buy it at 80$ or more (because Carrie is unwilling to pay more)
    <ul>
      <li>Taylor’s <strong>consumer surplus</strong> is her willingness to pay minus the price she paid</li>
      <li>If there are two albums to sell, then both Taylor and Carrie receive a consumer surplus, and the total market consumer surplus rises</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Can use the demand schedule shown above to create a demand curve
    <ul>
      <li>Price is represented by the <em>marginal buyer</em>, or the buyer that would leave if the price was raised</li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196594003-456c65ac-340a-492a-aff1-f28f596cb278.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 8 54 46 PM">
</li>
      <li>Depending on the quantity, the price of the album drops according to each buyer’s willingness to pay</li>
      <li><em>The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market.</em></li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196594409-b565e803-42b1-4c5f-9402-10032a5e04d7.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 8 58 44 PM">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Demand curve represents maximum willingness to pay</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>At lower prices, the price of the good is lower than more consumers’ value of the good, thus leading to a higher consumer surpus</li>
  <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196594552-147dd515-4c35-4bc4-89ed-328bfec1e7dd.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 00 02 PM">
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Does Consumer Surplus Measure?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being from the perspective of the buyers, as they are getting good value</li>
  <li>Consumer surplus can sometimes be ignored in a market; lowering the price of heroine is not good but would increase consumer surplus</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#7-2-producer-surplus" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7-2: Producer Surplus</h3>

<p><strong>Cost and the Willingness to Sell</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Cost</strong>: The value of everything (resources, manpower, time) that a seller uses to produce a good, essentially equivalent to willingness to sell</li>
  <li>Consider the following scenario where four sellers are competing to paint a house:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Seller</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Vincent</td>
      <td>900</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Claude</td>
      <td>800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pablo</td>
      <td>600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Andy</td>
      <td>500</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>In an auction, the price would start high and quickly lower to 500$; Andy would offer a price of 600$ or slightly lower and take the job (because Pablo is unwilling to sell for lower than 600$)
    <ul>
      <li>Andy’s <strong>consumer surplus</strong> is the price he sells his service at minus his cost of production</li>
      <li>If there are two houses to paint, then Pablo and Andy will both receive a producer surplus, and the total market producer surplus rises</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Can use the supply schedule shown above to create a supply curve
    <ul>
      <li>Price is represented by the <em>marginal seller</em>, or the seller that would leave if the price was lowered</li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196595587-2caf1b68-17e4-4f14-aa96-9959b14ad77b.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 09 20 PM">
</li>
      <li>Depending on the quantity, the price of the service raises according to each seller’s cost</li>
      <li><em>The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market.</em></li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196595776-d430ae67-f796-4596-a8c1-eb83f9d809fd.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 11 08 PM">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A higher price increases producer surplus because more producers get a higher profit margin for their service</li>

<p><strong>The Benevolent Social Planner</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider a dictator who wants to maximize economic well-being in society</li>
  <li>Can calculate <em>total surplus</em> in a market by adding consumer and producer surplus
    <ul>
      <li>Total surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers = Buyers’ willingness to pay - Sellers’ cost</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus <u>exhibits **efficiency**</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Inefficient allocations include ones where producers are, wastefully, having higher costs to produce or ones where goods aren’t consumed by buyers who value them the most</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Equality</strong>: Whether buyers and sellers both have similar levels of economics well-being</li>
  <li>Thinking of the market as a pie, efficiency attempts to make the pie as big as possible while equality attempts to split it evenly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evaluating the Market Equilibrium</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>At the equilibrium, the buyers who value the good the most and the sellers who have the lowest cost both consume/produce the good; therefore, the market equilibrium represents the greatest total surplus
    <ul>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196596765-3aecf1c5-0a26-4f16-96d5-702b9573462c.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 19 52 PM">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Free markets also naturally produce the quantity of goods which maximize total surplus; reducing the quantity creates a shortage, while increasing the quantity creates a surplus
    <ul>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196597014-6a2fd041-59de-49b8-a462-a2b459f512e6.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 22 08 PM">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The benevolent dictator need not intervene; the invisible hand of the market will do everything for them</li>
</ul>
