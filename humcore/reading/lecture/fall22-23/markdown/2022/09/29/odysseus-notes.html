<ul>
  <li>Two worlds presented
    <ul>
      <li>Cyclops island is shown as bountiful and plentiful (122-125, 129-137, 143-149)
        <ul>
          <li>Cyclops don’t even need to farm; the land gives everything to them</li>
          <li>Polyphemus is an intelligent cyclops who, unlike others, can herd sheep and farm well</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Odysseus describes Cyclops as extremely unintelligent and uncivilized (118-121, 125-126, 138-141)
        <ul>
          <li>Essentially calls Cyclops “animals”</li>
          <li>Cyclops are extremely gigantic and massive
            <ul>
              <li>Odysseus uses nature to describe his size (210-214, 266-274)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Odysseus’s journey is filled with peril and is an uphill battle to defeat gods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Odysseus invades Polyphemus’s world; eats his sheep, drinks his wine, etc.</li>
  <li>Polyphemus responds by killing his men and laughing, saying that he does not fear the gods
    <ul>
      <li>Both characters show ego; Polyphemus does not fear Odysseus and his men, Odysseus says his name and makes sound while leaving</li>
      <li>Both characters pay for their ego; Polyphemus loses his eye, Odysseus is cursed by Poseidon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contextualizing Odyssey 9
    <ul>
      <li>In the first four books, Odysseus is the storyteller and tells his story to the Pharacians in hopes that they give him gifts and thank them for their hospitality</li>
      <li>It’s a biased perspective; he wants to boast about himself</li>
      <li>Odyssey 9 is part of the first four books</li>
      <li>Odyssey is Odysseus trying to convince the Pharacians that he is famous and important</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Xenia: “guest-friendship” or “ritualized friendship”
    <ul>
      <li>Protected by Zeus as a tradition, comes from word <em>xenios</em>, or stranger/guest</li>
      <li>5 steps that the host must follow
        <ol>
          <li>Invite guest in</li>
          <li>Offer them a meal</li>
          <li>Ask for their name</li>
          <li>Exchange gifts</li>
          <li>Offer them a safe escort home</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Polyphemus breaks xenia
    <ul>
      <li>Asks for name first (264) before offering a meal</li>
      <li>Didn’t provide a meal (324-329)</li>
      <li>Promised a gift but it was ironic (413-414)</li>
      <li>Doesn’t provie a safe escort home (585-593)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Odysseus punishes Polyphemus by blinding him with his club
    <ul>
      <li>Uses Polyphemus’s belongings (the club) and forming it into a weapon (the mast of a ship)</li>
      <li>Uses an olive tree which is representative of Athena</li>
      <li>“Now at last I thrust…breathed enormous”</li>
      <li>“Hoisting high the olive stake…blazed and hissed”</li>
      <li>Justifies it by asking for help from the gods</li>
      <li>Punishment is delivered by mulitple people in an organized and cooperative way</li>
      <li>Drives stake into the eye in a circular motion (Cyclops = circular eye)</li>
      <li>Destroying vision = removing the intellectual sense (sight = intelligence)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Much imagery of “the last shall be first” in Odysseus’s escape (482-486, 495-504)
    <ul>
      <li>Can be interpreted as “Polyphemus is stupid”</li>
      <li>Odysseus wants to also show his greatness as a leader; “I let my men leave before I left”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Odysseus goes by three names in the text: Outis (Nobody), Metis (Nobody), and Odysseus
    <ul>
      <li>Metis also means nobody, but can also mean wisdom and represents Athena’s mother</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Discussing the lands and people</li>
  <li>Constructing the character of the cyclops</li>
  <li>Constructing the character of Odysseus</li>
</ul>
