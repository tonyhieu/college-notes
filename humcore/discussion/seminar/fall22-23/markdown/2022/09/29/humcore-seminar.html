    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rhetoric - art of persuasion, focus on ethos/logos/pathos</p>
  </li>
  <li>Creating Rhetorical Analysis
    <ul>
      <li>Look at what the words say, not at what the author or character believes/feels
        <ul>
          <li>Odysseus turns himself into the hero; what appeals does he use?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can appeal to humor, power, inequality, privilege, reason, agency, gender, wealth, custom, audience, etc.</li>
      <li>Think of literary devices in the context of rhetoric; is a metaphor appealing to power? danger?</li>
      <li>Analyze setting, character, genre, etc. to see what the rhetorical function is</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ethos in lines 324-340
    <ul>
      <li>Polyphemus described as inhuman, animalistic, idiotic; uses words like “maw”, “ruthless”, etc.</li>
      <li>Odysseus describes himself and his men as intelligent but much smaller than the cyclops</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Framework Narrative: an episodic story where one part leads to another</p>
  </li>
  <li>Think about the lecture and its relations to the text, its genre, its audience, culture, course themes, etc.</li>
  <li>Think about the claim a lecture is making, how the lecturer suports it, and make a new connection with it</li>
  <li>Write and answer discussion questions to think beyond the lecture
    <ul>
      <li>ex. In what specific ways is Polyphemus’ club used in his punishment? Why is this choice important for Odysseus’ story?</li>
      <li>What is at stake for Odysseus in his role as story-teller to the Phaeacians?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For Tuesday: find a passage in Odyssey 9 and write a rhetorical analysis to share
    - What appeals are at work? What words in the passage/features of genre do this work explain? So what?</p>
