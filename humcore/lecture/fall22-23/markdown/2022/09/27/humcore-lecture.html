    <p>Goal of lecture: identify questions being asked</p>

<ul>
  <li>First example of worldbuilding: creating fictional “countries” based on real countries, such as Ecotopia and Cascadia (with both countries being on the American West Coast)
    <ul>
      <li>Spurs thinking about what you need in a world and what could be possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Worldbuilding</strong>: Creating worlds and stories through media; must take into account many factors
    <ul>
      <li>Can also use worldbuilding to build a better world in real life; rallies, secret meetings, revolution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Late Anthroprocene</strong>: The current, modern era in Earth’s history (vs. jurassic, triassic, etc.)
    <ul>
      <li>Some consider it amazing (one species has had so much impact on Earth), others don’t (climate change)</li>
      <li>What kind of worldbuilding is possible in the late anthroprocene?</li>
      <li>How do we prepare ourselves to build — and rebuild — our world?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rhetoric</strong>: The art of talking and persuading
    <ul>
      <li>Must take into account your position, your audience, your purpose, the context, etc.</li>
      <li>Originated in Ancient Rome as a way to gain power in a democratic government</li>
      <li>Key to effective communication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Aesthetic (Education)</strong>: The idea that everyone should be generally educated so they can move between careers/jobs
    <ul>
      <li>Created in order to have more educated, well-informed students</li>
      <li>Gen ed classes are based off of aesthetic education</li>
      <li>Arts and humanities spur self-reflection and thinking, making it a requirement for an aesthetic (general) education</li>
      <li>May have led to Europe being more advanced compared to the rest of the world, thus European world domination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What kinds of minds and characters can we cultivate that OUR WORLD cannot afford to be without?</li>
</ul>
