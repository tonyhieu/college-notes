  <li>What does colonization look like from a non-European perspective?
    <ul>
      <li>Implied in HG Wells’ <em>The War of the Worlds</em>, how do people (specifically Europeans) react to colonization?</li>
      <li>Utopia / dystopia / heterotopia

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wants to challenge white history and colonization and prophesize a new future</li>
  <li>How do histories of racism/slavery induce futures of power?</li>
