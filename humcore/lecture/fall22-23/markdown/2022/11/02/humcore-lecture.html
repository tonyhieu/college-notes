    <ul>
  <li>Day 6
    <ul>
      <li>Under the rule of Elissa and the midpoint of the Decameron</li>
      <li>Theme is “characters who get out of a dangerous situation using their wits”
        <ul>
          <li>Highlights the emphasis on wit and cunning that has been present throughout the <em>Decameron</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Disruption of maids/servants infighting coming from the kitchen
        <ul>
          <li>Argument between Licisca and Tindaro over if women are virgins when they marry
            <ul>
              <li>Licisca argues that women often must wait too long for their fathers/brothers to marry them and they lose their virginity earlier</li>
              <li>Licisca also states that women often play tricks on their husbands to keep them out of the loop, inspires Dioneo’s theme</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The brigata women laugh at Licisca’s statements of lower-class “truth”, shows what the women really “know”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Story VI.10: Frate/Firar Cipolla
    <ul>
      <li>Dioneo typically strays away from the days theme but instead decides to stay on topic</li>
      <li>Connection to II.5, the story of Andreuccio (trickery)</li>
      <li>Connection to IV.2, the story of a wife cheating on her husband with the Archangel Gabriel</li>
      <li>Focus on servants
        <ul>
          <li>The servant, Guccio, and his love interest, Nuta (a waitress), are both similar in the fact that they are both described as lower class and unattractive</li>
          <li>Emphasis on classism
            <ul>
              <li>Nuta is just as careful as upper class women as to who she accepts, as she denies Guccio’s attempts at seduction</li>
              <li>Implies that upper class women, and the brigata in general, hide their more unpleasant sides
                <ul>
                  <li>Bigger analogy to the brigata and the idea of hiding from the “real world”, or plague</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Dioneo talks a little bit about merchant protectionism, as he states that foreign goods hurt the Italian market</li>
      <li>Big use of situational/dramatic irony
        <ul>
          <li>The friar implies that he’s BS’ing the audience by saying that he went to places such as “Conland”, “Clownland”, “Liarland”, and met a reverend named Dontblameme Ifyouplease</li>
          <li>Talks about a bunch of silly artifacts, like the sound of bells in a jar and a vial of St. Michael’s sweat</li>
          <li>The narrator is empathetic towards the audience because it’s easy to be seduced by a well spoken man</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cipolla is portrayed as a great orator and persuader
        <ul>
          <li>“Merchant hero”, mixes truth and lies in order to trick and convince</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bocaccio discusses the manipulation of the faithful (lower class must assume that the upper class/literate are telling the truth) and underlines a main literary device: substitution, or metaphors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>End of Day 6
    <ul>
      <li>The brigata moves even further away from Florence, to the Valley of the Ladies</li>
      <li>The women bath in a stream away from the men, knowing that they cannot be seen by the men in the group but also knowing that they are alone
        <ul>
          <li>They discuss that they have been honorable since moving away, having not acted in the same way as Licisca says that women do</li>
          <li>The men later go to the stream to bath themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Dioneo states the theme of the day will be wives who play tricks on their husbands, and he justifies it by stating that the stories will provide pleasure + women only play tricks for “self-preservation”</li>
      <li>Days 7, 8, and 9 will track the brigata’s journey back to Florence
        <ul>
          <li>Stories continue to feature Florentine/Tuscan characters and locations</li>
          <li>More indecent tales, a tribute to medieval French tales</li>
          <li>A local figure, Calandrino, appears in four different stories - intratextuality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Day 8
    <ul>
      <li>Lauretta is the queen, and the theme is tricks</li>
      <li>Brigata leaves the Valley of the Ladies and goes to the palace, coming back towards Florence</li>
      <li>They take a weekend break for religious purposes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calandrino tales
    <ul>
      <li>First time that a set of recurring characters appears in the <em>Decameron</em>: Bruno, Buffalmacco, and Calandrino
        <ul>
          <li>Based on actual Florentine characters</li>
          <li>All three are fresco painters which was a guild trade, meaning that many painters worked on a piece together as a job (not really artists)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Calandrino embodies many of the disliked traits in the book: Vanity, Greed, Foolishness, Ignorance, Misogyny</li>
      <li>Tales focus much on food and hunger which was representative of medieval economics; food was extremely important, meat was scarce</li>
      <li>VIII.3 - The Heliotrope
        <ul>
          <li>Cruel humor and situational irony, extremely popular in the Middle Ages</li>
          <li>Calandrino and Andreuccio both act as unknowing characters who believe themselves to be sly</li>
          <li>Dantean punishment: Bruno and Buffalmacco throw stones at him after he believes that he’s turned invisible, representative of “stoning him for his sin of hiding his good fortune”</li>
          <li>Bocaccio may be satirizing misogynists of his time by implying that Calandrino, who is an idiot, thinks misogynistically and beats his wife</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Calandrino represents as an outsider from the countryside, while Bruno and Buffalmacco are representatives of Florentine tricksters and merchants</li>
      <li>Many Calandrino tales detail his issues with his wife</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
