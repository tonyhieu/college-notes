    <ul>
  <li>In the science fiction world, the <em>Parable</em> is a novum
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporates new aspects of science fiction</li>
      <li>Many “strange” aspects of the reality in the <em>Parable</em>; Lauren’s hyperempathy is unrealistic but has roots in reality
        <ul>
          <li>Lauren gets hyperempathy due to her mother taking drugs while pregnant</li>
          <li>Bankole suggests that hyperempathy might be a good thing, as people would be hesitant to hurt others</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drugs in <em>Parable</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Many of the characters are directly affected by drugs
        <ul>
          <li>Either their family took drugs and got addicted or were hurt by drug addicts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pyro, or “Ro”, causes people to commit arson and murder</li>
      <li>The paints are another group of people who murder others, especially the rich</li>
      <li>Lauren’s mother takes Paracetco which acts as a performance enhancer; increases positive traits and minimizes negative ones</li>
      <li>Drugs act as a form of escapism from the harsh reality of the <em>Parable</em></li>
      <li>During Butler’s time, drugs were newly used and uncommon
        <ul>
          <li>Drug use was emphasized in <em>Parable</em> to create the dystopia; an extreme version of her reality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Neoliberalism
    <ul>
      <li>The most prevalent form of political theory currently</li>
      <li>Accepts that there is a free market and asserts that each person is responsible for themselves and must “play” in the free market
        <ul>
          <li>Everything is economized, every entity is governed as a firm, humans are nothing but market actors</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Because neoliberalisms values competition and the free market, social welfare goes into decline
        <ul>
          <li>The 20th century saw the erosion of social welfare into free market policies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Parable of the Sower</em> takes capitalism to an extreme
        <ul>
          <li>Commodities are rare (rather than luxuries) and jobs are few because people are naturally greedy and take more than they should have</li>
          <li>Basic necessities now have markets: food, water, shelter</li>
          <li>Government agencies such as police and firefighters only service the highest bidder</li>
          <li>The paints described in the book literally kill the rich because they are disillusioned with income disparity</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hyperempathy
    <ul>
      <li>Acts as a foil to drugs; instead of numbing or escaping reality, the condition forces one to closely examine it</li>
      <li>How does the world become the one in <em>Parable</em>? Where are the people who care?
        <ul>
          <li>Hyperempaths therefore have the power to change the world, seen in <em>Parable of the Talents</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Butler wants people to become more empathetic (“make people feel”) and uses hyperempathy as a vehicle to do so</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Butler’s writing attempts to encourage others to build a new world where people are more empathetic and caring
    <ul>
      <li>Linked the Republic, Decameron, etc. because both encourage the telling of stories to better society</li>
      <li>Acknowledges that hyperempathy isn’t always a good thing, but some progress can go a long way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
