    <ul>
  <li>The main goal of media is to send a message and garner emotion; rhetoric
    <ul>
      <li>The Obama Hope Poster was a form of rhetorical circulation, or a piece of rhetoric that is spread out amongst the public</li>
      <li>A rhetorically circulated piece might be picked up and repurposed into a different movement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A paraliterary approach is one where readers read things at face level instead of reading deeply; reading for pleasure
    <ul>
      <li>Very different than literary analysis</li>
      <li>Provides a sense of comfort, surface level empathy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lauren’s character takes inspiration from Butler; they both read whatever they could get their hands on and extrapolate</li>
  <li>Butler’s vision for the Parable series was to make the third book more hopeful, create a better world
    <ul>
      <li>Shows that the first two were meant to show the evil of humanity while the third was to show the hope of it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adrienne Maree Brown misreads Parable of the Sower; takes Earthseed and tries to develop it in a way that Lauren would not have (because Lauren is not hopeful)</li>
  <li>Some people have tried to create their own Earthseed communities, shows impact of the book</li>
</ul>
