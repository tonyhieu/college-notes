    <ul>
  <li>The Matrix: etymology of “matrix” and the film in a nutshell
    <ul>
      <li>Etymology
        <ul>
          <li>Comes from the word “womb” in Latin, also “source, origin” from word mater in Late Latin</li>
          <li>Gained its meaning from the womb enclosing and giving origin (birth) to something</li>
          <li>Developed its modern meaning by the 1640s</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Themes of reality/non-reality, deception, enslavement, good/evil
        <ul>
          <li>Virtual reality is the matrix, 1999 simulation, while actual reality is a post-apocalyptic world near 2199</li>
          <li>Machines enslave and farm humans for power</li>
          <li>Humans are deceived and brought into a false reality so they relax and can provide energy for the machines</li>
          <li>The good human rebellion attempts to take down the evil machinery</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The look of The Matrix
    <ul>
      <li>Focuses on time; real world is set in the 22nd century while it represents the 1990s thoughts on virtual reality/AI</li>
      <li>Inside the matrix, there are many green hues in highlights, shadows to represent computer text</li>
      <li>Outside the matrix, the Earth is razed, and the movie uses more blue colors (cold desolation)</li>
      <li>THe loading program is filled with white, represents a medium that isn’t affected by the matrix or reality</li>
      <li>The Matrix also uses some colors to “pull you out” (such as the woman in red)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Matrix as a philosophical and genre patchwork
    <ul>
      <li>Philosophical references
        <ul>
          <li>Plato and the Cave; “know thyself”</li>
          <li>Rene Descartes - how do you know that you’re awake rather than dreaming?</li>
          <li>George Berkeley and immaterialism - the world is made up from your mind; all reality is immaterial
            <ul>
              <li>Relates to scene with the spoon</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do you want to know what the Matrix is?
    <ul>
      <li>Morpheus poses question to Neo, asks if he really wants to know what the Matrix is because Neo might not be able handle the truth (that he is enslaved)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bluepill or redpill?
    <ul>
      <li>Scene with Neo taking the redpill from Morpheus’ hand, reflected in glasses</li>
      <li>Bluepill = stay in world of beliefs, dreams; redpill = <em>knowledge</em>, know what the world around you is</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plato’s Cave and The Matrix: similarities and differences
    <ul>
      <li>Agents turning into code at end of film; represents enlightenment, shows understanding of distinction between reality and non-reality (Forms vs. particulars)</li>
      <li>Cypher represents a “released prisoner” who <em>chooses</em> to come back to the Cave</li>
      <li>Plato’s Cave is continuous; the real world is outside of the cave, while imitations of the real world are inside of the cave
        <ul>
          <li>The Matrix’s two worlds are discontinuous; the matrix is simulated and takes place in 1999, while the real world is set in 2199 and is completely destroyed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Knowledge of the Good vs. Self-Knowledge
        <ul>
          <li>Released prisoner must understand the Forms and the Good; abstract knowledge</li>
          <li>Neo must understand knowledge about himself; the truth is within him and around him</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Senses and vision
        <ul>
          <li>Both Neo and the released prisoner find that their senses aren’t adequate and easily deceived</li>
          <li>Both need to learn to see (“Why do my eyes hurt?” - Neo)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jean Baudrillard: Simulacra and Simulation
    <ul>
      <li>Simulacra are copies of things that EITHER had no originals to begin with OR no longer have originals</li>
      <li>Copies which take on their own reality, the “hyperreal”</li>
      <li>“Welcome to the desert of the real”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two Qs from the Cave, two As from the Matrix
    <ul>
      <li>Questions
        <ul>
          <li>Who are the puppeteers and why are they carrying the artifacts?</li>
          <li>What/who starts the process of enlightenment?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Answers
        <ul>
          <li>The agents and the machines use humans as a power source
            <ul>
              <li>Implies that the puppeteers might be political oppressors who want to keep humans chained and enslaved by shadows of the real</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Morpheus and Trinity free Neo because he is the One
            <ul>
              <li>Implies that the liberator in the cave might be a teacher, similar to Morpheus or Socrates
                <ul>
                  <li>Cypher complains about having no freedom, as Morpheus tells him what to do (compulsion)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Socrates notes that someone/something forces the prisoner to stand up, but WE compel the prisoner (second person, includes Socrates)</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Neo - anagram of One and prefix meaning “new”, also refers to a club that housed the goth subculture of the 80s and 90s
        <ul>
          <li>Anderson: son of Andrew, Greek word Andreas means “man”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Trinity - refers to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost</li>

      <li></li>

  </li>
</ul>
