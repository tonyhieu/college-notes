    <ul>
  <li>What is the Cave
    <ul>
      <li>Contained in Book 7, 514a-517c</li>
      <li>Acts as an allegory to generalize human existence</li>
      <li>Socrates imagines the cave, which is reflective of the lowest part of the divided line</li>
      <li>Supposition - what <em>would</em> happen if a prisoner <em>should</em> be freed? A “world less vivid”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The topography of the cave
    <ul>
      <li>Underground cave with prisoners and free inhabitants</li>
      <li>Entrance is very far up, has light and is as wide as the cave</li>
      <li>Lit by a large fire above and behind the prisoners</li>
      <li>On <em>higher ground</em>, a path stretches between the prisoners and the fire
        <ul>
          <li>Puppets are shown on this path above a low wall, and the shadows are shown to the prisoners</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The cave as vertical stratification of space</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The cave-dwellers
    <ul>
      <li>Prisoners
        <ul>
          <li>Humans who have lived in the cave their whole lives, cannot move their bodies at all and can only see in front of them</li>
          <li>Can tell the difference between different shadows and sounds</li>
          <li>Can name shadows and discern patterns in their presentation</li>
          <li>No self-perception or perception of those around them</li>
          <li>Shadows talk if puppeteers talk</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Puppeteers
        <ul>
          <li>Also humans with an ambiguous motivation, carry artifacts to show shadows</li>
          <li>Some speak, some are silent
            <ul>
              <li>Speakers only do so to make sound effects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The release of the One &amp; its painful effects
    <ul>
      <li>One prisoner must stand up, turn his head, walk, and look up towards the light (all physical verbs)
        <ul>
          <li>Beginning of enlightenment is to turn the head</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The One would be pained, dazzled, and unable to see the objects that cast the shadows (puppets)</li>
      <li>He would be at a loss if he learned that the objects were more real than the shadows themselves</li>
      <li>His eyes would hurt if he looked at the fire, and he would want to turn back</li>
      <li>He’d be pained if he wanted to walk up</li>
      <li>After escaping, he wouldn’t be able to see the things outside of the cave</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The forceful liberator
    <ul>
      <li>Someone/something <u>suddenly compels</u> a prisoner to stand up
        <ul>
          <li>“Suddenly” breaks the structure and flow of the time perceived in the cave</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The prisoner would be at a loss if <em>we</em> <u>compelled</u> the prisoner, someone <u>compels</u> the prisoner to look at the light
        <ul>
          <li>Notice use of we vs. someone; someone is ambiguous and unknown, uncertain</li>
          <li>The liberator is unknown and a wild variable that breaks the highly structured world of the Cave</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Someone drags the prisoner using force and doesn’t stop dragging him until he has reached the sunlight</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cave, Line, &amp; Sun
    <ul>
      <li>Visible Realm
        <ul>
          <li>Inside the cave/lower line</li>
          <li>Involves shadows - reflections, shadows, illusions -&gt; any images (Level 1 of the Line)</li>
          <li>“To see, to believe”</li>
          <li>Puppets -&gt; physical objects (Level 2 of the Line)</li>
          <li>Fire allows objects to be seen</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Intellectual Realm
        <ul>
          <li>Shadows, images of men and other things in water -&gt; Mathematics and hypotheticals (Level 3 of the Line)
            <ul>
              <li>“To see”</li>
              <li>Not yet in the outside world of the Cave</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Things themselves (things in the sky, night time objects) -&gt; Forms (level 4 of the Line)
            <ul>
              <li>“To see, to study”</li>
              <li>Leave the cave</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The sun, provides light and therefore intelligence to mankind -&gt; The Good
            <ul>
              <li>“To see, to study, to infer, to include”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why do we need the Cave if we have the Line?
    <ul>
      <li>The Line is a geometric figure, while the Cave is a story about humanity</li>
      <li>The Line implies continuity and progress between the lower and upper line, while the Cave implies a sharp divide between outside and inside the Cave</li>
      <li>In the lower line, belief is “automatic” and comes after they see physical objects, while in the cave, belief is difficult and requires effort</li>
      <li>The Line makes transitions from one part to another seem smooth, while in the Cave each transition requires an external force which comepls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Back to the Cave
    <ul>
      <li>A released prisoner coming back to the cave would not be able to see in the cave; too dark</li>
      <li>If they talked to the perpetual prisoners, they would be ridiculed</li>
      <li>Other prisoners would say that the released prisoner would have ruined their eyesight and that the journey up was worthless</li>
      <li>If they tried to free the chained prisoners, they would be killed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
