    <ul>
  <li>Barolini’s Essay - the wheel of the <em>Decameron</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Two part structure in the introduction: damaged, plague city of Florence and the rebirth of intelligence in the countryside</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Day 1 Story 1
    <ul>
      <li>Told by Panfilo (all loving)</li>
      <li>Has a lengthy preamble about religion and if prayers are truly efficient</li>
      <li>Argues that God can hear all sincere prayers through insincere ones; they always arrive at their destination</li>
      <li>Ser Cepparello is an awful person (symbolic of a chaotic world) who is able to be seen as a great person (stable unity of God)
        <ul>
          <li>Cepparello is described as one of the worst types of people ever</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Ceparello is a merchant, a job which is often praised in the <em>Decameron</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Currently unemployed, was a notary (legal accountant), cheats and murders</li>
          <li>The French call him Ciappelletto which is indicative of the human tendency to distory reality</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Story acts as a parody of different literary traditions, such as confessional and the hagiographic
        <ul>
          <li>False confessions have comedic timing with Ceparello lying in his answers while the reader knows its the opposite</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Different “circles” of listeners
        <ul>
          <li>Priest: believes all of Ciappelletto’s words, criticizes his parishioners for not being like him</li>
          <li>Usurers/Loaners: eavesdroppers, laugh at the lies</li>
          <li>The Faithful: believe the priest and believe that many miracles have been done through his body</li>
          <li>Brigata Listeners (real world): No way to know if Ciappelletto truly repented, but Panfilo suggests that as long as your faith is true, you will be accepted</li>
          <li>Us (the reader): Bocaccio argues that wicked things may provide beneficial truths, even if those truths are naturally ambiguous</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why make this the first tale?
        <ul>
          <li>Ciappelletto is the first “model” storyteller</li>
          <li>The rest of the stories fall under Ciappelletto’s; signifies following stories will be raunchy but attempt to appeal to God</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Day 1
        <ul>
          <li>Tales 2, 3, and 4 relate to religion</li>
          <li>2 talks about a Jewish merchant who notices that the Church is corrupt but is prospering because of it, making Christianity favorable; merchant’s reasoning</li>
          <li>3 has a “wise” Jew tell a tale within the tale about how it’s impossible to know which of the major religions was valid; uses metaphor of three brothers with three rings with none of them knowing which ring is real</li>
          <li>4 shows a monk exposing the hypocrisy of his Abbot by playing a trick on him even though the Abbot planned to expose the monk’s trick</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bocaccio intends to show that religious officials are not above “regular” humans and are not in a position to judge
        <ul>
          <li>Also argues that all faiths are similar</li>
          <li>Uses merchants to show that you need to work together to prosper</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Day 2’s theme is “reversals of bad to good fortune”</li>
  <li>Continues general theme of intelligence</li>
  <li>Merchants become frequent protagonists</li>
  <li>Day 2 Story 5 takes the form of a folk/fairy tale and shows the romances of education
    <ul>
      <li>Starts as a typical exposition of a folk tale; Andreuccio hears of Naples and brings 500 gold to make his fortune there</li>
      <li>Switch in perspective from Andreuccio to the Sicilian woman</li>
      <li><strong>Situational irony</strong>: Andreuccio has no knowledge of his situation, but the reader/other characters in the story do</li>
      <li>Perugia stands for the land of innocence while Naples stands for the land of cunning and trickery</li>
      <li>Story takes place as a series of journeys
        <ul>
          <li>Perugia to Naples</li>
          <li>The journey inside of Naples: inn, market, Malportugia, church/tomb, well</li>
          <li>Parody of the “journey to the underworld”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Trebling</strong>: patterns of three
        <ul>
          <li>Bocaccio uses trebling to show Andreuccio’s education</li>
          <li>Andreuccio falls three times, and each time, he goes into darkness and gains a little bit more insight
            <ul>
              <li>Fall 1: Falls into the toilet, realizes that he’s been tricked, leaves while naked and covered in sewage</li>
              <li>Fall 2: Meets two men who <em>inform</em> him that he would have been killed had he not fallen
                <ul>
                  <li>Is lowered into a well in order to clean up, but the two thieves leave him while guards come</li>
                  <li>Develops suspicion but still doesn’t know where he’s going</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fall 3: Goes into the tomb and grabs the jewelry off of the Archbishop’s finger
                <ul>
                  <li>Understands that the two thieves are trying to trick him, takes the ring and lies to the thieves</li>
                  <li>Left for dead inside of the tomb, faints and is described as looking like a corpse</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Andreuccio is able to free himself from the last fall by grabbing the leg of another thief
                <ul>
                  <li>“Resurrected” as a new man who is no longer innocence</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perspective changes throughout the story
        <ul>
          <li>We are never “with” Andreuccio until when he is in the tomb; always above/below/removed from him</li>
          <li>Signals that the listener’s should have empathy only when Andreuccio is in the tomb, as we gain information from him</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each fall is a mock version of different moments on a spiritual journey as told on the Christian calendar
        <ul>
          <li>Fall 1: fall into filth and sin, leaving Eden and going to the real world</li>
          <li>Fall 2: Baptism, cleansing of sin</li>
          <li>Fall 3: sacrament of Confirmation; Confirmation shows proof that one is Christian, an adolescent kisses the ring on a bishop’s finger
            <ul>
              <li>Entry into the “light” of Christian knowledge, symbolized by the theives’ lantern</li>
              <li>Andreuccio literally steals the ring</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Has references to Dante, especially in Dante’s books and worlds (Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
