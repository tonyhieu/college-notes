    <ul>
  <li>Decameron was one of the first pieces of Italian literature
    <ul>
      <li>Written around 1350 and rewritten in the 1370s</li>
      <li>Founding, major piece in Italian literature and prose</li>
      <li>Was praised in its time but also banned for being obscene later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contains one hundred tales over ten days told by seven women and three men (a group called a brigata)
    <ul>
      <li>The group escaped Florence after the Plague, and they spend their time telling stories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leaping and linking from the ancient texts to the <em>Decameron</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The other texts that we’ve read (Odyssey, Plato, Virgil) spanned two thousand years before the <em>Decameron</em></li>
      <li>Bocaccio lived 1300 years after Virgil and 2400 after Homer</li>
      <li>Bocaccio read Virgil’s works in Latin, but he did not read (but knew about) Homer and Plato because he didn’t know Greek
        <ul>
          <li>The translation and recuperation of ancient Greek and Roman knowledge drove the Italian Renaissance</li>
          <li>Bocaccio + Petrarch were its first proponents</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Decameron</em> Keywords; words to think about and consider
    <ul>
      <li>compassion</li>
      <li>humanity</li>
      <li>intelligence</li>
      <li>reason</li>

  <li>Bocaccio versus the “Author”
    <ul>
      <li>Bocaccio
        <ul>
          <li>Had an intelligent father but was illegitimate</li>
          <li>Went to law school, learned a lot about literature</li>
          <li>Friends with Petrarch</li>
          <li>Controls the book</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Author
        <ul>
          <li>The voice who states that he wrote the book</li>
          <li>Representation of Bocaccio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The “Author” in recovery from lovesickness
    <ul>
      <li>Author states that he was in pain because of love</li>
      <li>Shows appreciation for his friends because they helped him through it</li>
      <li>Wants to help others get through lovesickness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <em>Decameron</em>’s addressees
    <ul>
      <li>At the time of writing, lovesickness was a big issue for Bocaccio’s contemporaries</li>
      <li>Arts, medical literature, etc. were created to describe it</li>
      <li>Bocaccio wishes to address women who often don’t have an outlet to express their lovesicknesses
        <ul>
          <li>Signals philogyny, or love of women</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ways of seeing the <em>Decameron</em>’s frame: Worlds and Tales
    <ul>
      <li>The frame gives the book as a whole a “complex, stylistic, semantic, and ideological coherence”</li>
      <li>The macrostructure of the frame supports the microstructures of the individual novellas and tales</li>
      <li>The novellas are ordered precisely and acquire meaning through their placement in the frame</li>
      <li>Each tale builds its own world, whether it be from the Author or each one of the characters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<img src="images/bocaccio-storytellers-and-stories.png" alt="image" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Frame as binding mechanism
    <ul>
      <li>Bocaccio defends his work using the Author as a character in different parts of the book, such as the introductions and conclusions (Outer Frame)
        <ul>
          <li>Wanted to build a literary tradition in Italian</li>
          <li>Establish secular literature as an art form</li>
          <li>State that world-building and play are essential human activities</li>
          <li>Celebrate Florence nad its culture</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Author’s narration of the “main story”
        <ul>
          <li>Describing the brigata, introducing each day, etc.</li>
          <li>Transitions between stories, reactions to stories</li>
          <li>Describing the background</li>
          <li>Keeps names of storytellers anonymous to protect their reputation; names are representative of their personalities</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Novellas inside of the main story
        <ul>
          <li>Storytellers tell 100 stories with different themes and ideas</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Characters in the novellas tell tales
        <ul>
          <li>Inside of the story, a character might tell a story</li>
          <li>Characters act as surrogates for their real-world counterparts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The plague: a horrific but necessary beginning
    <ul>
      <li>Reference to Dante and how he brings the reader through hell before starting</li>
      <li>Thinks of it as a necessary evil</li>
      <li>Boccacio’s description uses medical and historical sources; is very accurate</li>
      <li>Humans didn’t understand the Plague’s origins and its consequences</li>
      <li>Killed 30-60% of Europe’s population and originated from the East, likely from China</li>
      <li>Many different responses to the plague: isolation, make merry and live each day as its last, quarantine in groups, adopt a minimalist lifestyle</li>
      <li>Brigata leaves town, justifies the decision based on natural rights</li>
      <li>Almost everyone who lived in their households either died or fled</li>
      <li>Led to social breakdown</li>
      <li>Many social and familial bonds broke, social expectations degenerated</li>
      <li>All human industry is destroyed; Bocaccio asks, “where have all these thiings gone?” (ubi sunt?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The political world of Florence and the political structure set up by the storytellers
    <ul>
      <li>Florentine Republic - an oligarchy that was ruled by the elite</li>
      <li>Rose and fell in power, was temporarily replaced by signories, or a de facto principality (single ruler)</li>
      <li>In the brigata, the members are all equal
        <ul>
          <li>Ruled by a monarchy where the ruler rotates every day</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bocaccio relates the historical aspects of Florence to the Decameron</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The pastoral <em>locus amoenus</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Pastoral setting, brigata lives in a villa with gardens</li>
      <li>Each garden acts as a locus amoenus which is a safe space</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A separate space for literary world building
    <ul>
      <li>Chaos of the “real world” plague vs. the order of the villa and stories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
