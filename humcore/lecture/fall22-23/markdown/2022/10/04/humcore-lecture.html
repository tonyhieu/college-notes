    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="odysseus-names">Odysseus’ name(s)</h2>

</ul>

<h2 id="odysseus-and-the-cyclops-2-readings">Odysseus and the Cyclops: 2 readings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reading 1: Odysseus and the Cyclops as foils, with Odysseus being the better one
    <ul>
      <li>Cyclops is large but dumb, culturally strange, a loner with no knowledge of politics, sacreligious</li>
      <li>Odysseus is small but crafty, culturally knowledgable, political genius, religious</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reading 2: Odysseus and the Cyclops as foils
    <ul>
      <li>Cyclops is a big sheperd, minds his own business and lives alone, lives near his neighbors, a tender man, and on good terms with his father Poseidon</li>
      <li>Odysseus is a small human who trespasses an empty house and eats their food; expects hospitality gifts and steals sheep from Polyphemus’ cave</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lotus represent forgetting home, symbolic death for Odysseus and his men because they lose their mission
    <ul>
      <li>Odysseus becomes a giver of lotus; gives Cyclops wine to trick him</li>
      <li>Odysseus shows himself as greed because he gives the Cyclops as much wine as he wants, no moderation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
