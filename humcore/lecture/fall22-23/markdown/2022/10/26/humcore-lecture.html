    <ul>
  <li>Reflections on the brigata’s interruption of their routine
    <ul>
      <li>On day 3, the daily queen is Neifile, theme is people who have gained/recovered things from their own resourcefulness</li>
      <li>Neifile insists that the group stops storytelling over the weekend so they can reflect on spiritual matters, restart on Sunday
        <ul>
          <li>On Friday, they would meditate on Christ’s crucifixion, and on Saturday, they would pay respect to the Virgin Mary</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Ladies will wash their hair over the weekend, important detail of personal hygiene such as when they washed their hands on Day One</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Change of Location
    <ul>
      <li>The brigata moves to a different palace with a large, enclosed garden in order to ensure that no one else will come</li>
      <li>The new palace’s garden is much bigger than the old one’s, and it combines nature with civilization (marble, mills, channels, water, plants, animals, etc.)</li>
      <li>Garden resembles a typical Mediterranean or Italian garden
        <ul>
          <li>Group decides to eat there, with the tables arranged around the fountain</li>
          <li>Spend time reading romances, playing chess (which was previously not allowed), throwing dice (gambling), and napping
            <ul>
              <li>Interesting that they allow for more “competitive” activities like chess and gambling</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Stands as stark contrast to the urban, plagued Florence</li>
          <li>Enclosed garden implies safety</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>theology vs. eroticism on day 3
    <ul>
      <li>Day 3 seems to be surrounded with theology; a two day break for prayer, and then the stories are told in a garden which resembles the Garden of Eden</li>
      <li>The stories told on the day contrast with this theological background, and they mix the secular and sacred in unique ways</li>
      <li>The stories focus on erotic instinct and female sexuality as well as class concerns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tale of Masetto III.1
    <ul>
      <li>Denies the claim that nuns have no sexual desire due to religion or fatigue</li>
      <li>The tale stages a complicity between Masetto and the nuns to address a common desire
        <ul>
          <li>Starts out as equals, but eventually Masetto is on the losing side as there are too many women to satisfy</li>
          <li>Claims that a woman’s sexual capacity is higher than a man</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The theme of muteness has already been touched upon in II.7 and it returns here as a catalyst for seduction</li>
      <li>The garden in the story is enclosed, as is the brigata’s</li>
      <li>Interpretations
        <ul>
          <li>Condemn the story for its amorality</li>
          <li>Celebrate it for its insistence on “natural” sexual instincts</li>
          <li>Has ties between the Garden of Eden (no desires before sin) and the human world that resulted from leaving the Garden
            <ul>
              <li>Bocaccio writes about the loss of harmony that resulted from leaving the Garden, and one of the side effects is the lovesickness that the Author writes about</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Nuns traditionally became brides of Christ and forewent physical desire in favor of spiritual satisfaction
        <ul>
          <li>In medieval and Renaissance, many men and women entered religious life out of economic necessity instead of free will</li>
          <li>Bocaccio doesn’t question those who are honest in their intentions, but acknowledges that they are often in a state of unfulfillment much of the time
            <ul>
              <li>Refuses to condemn them for acting on their desires</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bocaccio mocks the thought of theologians and doctors
        <ul>
          <li>Many want to think that nuns leave their sexual instinct behind when they enter religious life</li>
          <li>The Greek theory of humors thought of women as lesser creatures than humans who needed to be controlled, leading to their isolation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use of many double entendres, such as “I’m going to work your garden for you better than it’s ever been worked before”
        <ul>
          <li>Never uses explicit profanity, never names body parts</li>
          <li>Juxtaposed with the last tale of day 2, in which a man doesn’t have sex with his wife and she leaves him</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Boccaccio encourages the reader to compare the brigata’s garden (recently spiritualized) with the nun’s garden (defiled)</li>
      <li>Joke of the story relies on the tradition that nuns are “brides of Christ”</li>
      <li>Masetto is rewarded with many children and believes that “this was the way, he maintained, that Christ treated anyone who set a pair of cuckold’s horns on His crown”
        <ul>
          <li>The cuckold is someone whose partner is sleeping with someone’s else, and they often wear horns</li>
          <li>The joke is that Christ approves when Masetto sleeps with the nuns</li>
          <li>In II.10, the neighboring women make the gesture of the cuckold when the wife has sex with her lover</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By pretending to be deaf and mute, Masetto induces situational irony when the nuns talk about sex in front of him; also lays the groundwork for his “miraculous recovery”
        <ul>
          <li>The miracle of regaining hearing is not because he actually regained it, but because the nuns had been using him for their sexual desire</li>
          <li>Ideas of miracles have prevailed in other stories; Ser Ciappelletto was miraculously saved</li>
          <li>Miracles are a handy way of excusing human behavior</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tale of Alibech III.10
    <ul>
      <li>Illicit story, ignored by critics until 1929</li>
      <li>In D.H. Lawrence’s book <em>Pornography and Obscenity</em>, Lawrence argues that such stories should be shared in order to have a more open discussion about sex
        <ul>
          <li>The story is also seen as extremely obscene and misogynistic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Boccaccio is offering a parody of the “monk going out to the desert to become spiritually enlightened” trope (Journey to the West)
        <ul>
          <li><em>The Life of Maria the Harlot</em> in particular was a very similar story that followed a young girl who lived in the desert as a hermit
            <ul>
              <li>Maria becomes seduced by a monk after she lives there for 18 years</li>
              <li>Maria turns to prostitution because she is ashamed, and her uncle visits her (pretending to be a customer) and tells her that she should not be ashamed</li>
              <li>Maria dies a saint in the desert</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Comparisons between Maria and Alibech
        <ul>
          <li>Maria’s uncle exhibits paternal love and responsibility while Rustico acts as a father figure and seduces/rapes her</li>
          <li>Both are seduced by a monk in the desert, but Maria is ashamed while Alibech is not</li>
          <li>Maria willingly leaves the city to return to the desert while Alibech is reluctant to leave the desert and go to the city</li>
          <li>Maria experiences trauma from her sexual experience while Alibech does not and wears out Rustico instead</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Boccaccio argues that sex is human behavior and a necessary evil
        <ul>
          <li>Both Rustico and Alibech fall victim to their sexual desires</li>
          <li>Alibech thinks of her sexual experience as a one-time thing while Rustico knows that he is sinning</li>
          <li>Rustico acts in bad faith but Alibech does not</li>
          <li>Alibech represents innocence</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Alibech lives in a sinless world; she doesn’t feel guilt because she believes her motives are pure
        <ul>
          <li>Women tell her that her new husband will help with those motives</li>
          <li>Alibech represents a “pure” sexual drive, while Rustico represents a sinful one</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rustico’s sins
        <ul>
          <li>First sin was pride, believed that he could resist the temptations of Alibech’s young body but failed</li>
          <li>Second sin was lust, could not recognize the control lust had over him</li>
          <li>Alibech commits neither of those sins, and her sexual drive is approved in this story through marriage and bearing children</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Alibech’s blameless behavior
        <ul>
          <li>Boccaccio believes that if one has pure intentions, then they will earn God’s grace</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Keep III.10 in mind while reading IV.1
        <ul>
          <li>Boccaccio achieves a comic effect through merging eroticism and asceticism</li>
          <li>Alibech’s experience is predicated on her innocence, and she has to face the city and face its social constructs after leaving the desert</li>
          <li>How is this similar to what the brigata memebers must do after they leave the palace?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Brief thoughts on Bocaccio’s “On Poetry” and the defense of figurative thinking
    <ul>
      <li>Excerpt from a larger work where Bocaccio discusses the family histories of pagan Greco-Roman gods</li>
      <li>Boccaccio defends literary writing and poetry which is the main idea of the Decameron</li>
      <li>Insists that writing often has “hidden” meanings which is the main benefit of poetry</li>
      <li>Boccaccio argues for studying texts and finding deeper meaning; refers to Biblical texts, such as when Jessu spoke in parables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
