    <ul>
  <li>The Russian Revolution and the Comintern
    <ul>
      <li>The Russian Revolution started in 1917, intitiated by the Bolsheviks + Vladimir Lenin and established a communist state</li>
      <li>Despite Russia being a non-developed, the revolution was justified by arguing that Russia would be the first state to set off a spark of communist sentiment
        <ul>
          <li>Supported by workers, soldiers</li>
          <li>Faced opposition from other European forces and pro-tsar Russians</li>
          <li>Starts with wanting a democratic form of government, but transitions to an autocratic one due to the state of constant war</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Russian proletariat was extremely small while agricultural workers were the majority; key disconnect between Marx and Engels’ idea of communism being born from a capitalist state</li>
      <li>The Comintern was created to unite communists worldwide in order to develop communism in Western Europe</li>
      <li>By 1920, the Bolsheviks are isolated both politically and geographically</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communism in the East
    <ul>
      <li>The Soviets turn to Asia and support anti-colonist struggles in Asia to spread communism</li>
      <li>The Comintern held a meeting in Azerbaijan with representatives from various movements throughout Asia
        <ul>
          <li>Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the Comintern, calls for an alliance between the western proletariat and the peasantry of Asia</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By creating a common enemy in Western Europe (colonizers), the Soviets create an alliance with Asian states</li>
      <li>The idea of anti-colonialism contradicted with classic communism, as anti-colonialists were often wealthy and part of the native bourgeoisie
        <ul>
          <li>The native bourgeoisie did not want to become communist; they simply wanted more power and were thus more conservative than revolutionary</li>
          <li>The Comintern debated over this contradiction, as there was a lot of contention over the issue of hypocrisy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Before the Russian Revolution, much of Southeast Asia was colonized by Europeans</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communism and Pan-Islamism in the Dutch East Indies
    <ul>
      <li>The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was founded in 1920 and was initially dominated by Dutch activists</li>
      <li>The Islamic Union (SI) was a pan-Islamist organization that was anti-coonial
        <ul>
          <li>Thought it was originally formed to protect Indonesian merchants, it expanded to recruiting poor peasants and working class</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Many members of the PKI joined the SI and shared the same anti-colonist views, but they maintained their own separate identities
        <ul>
          <li>Used the Comintern’s “bloc within” strategy where communists joined anti-colonial organizations to further their cause but maintained separation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tan Malaka
    <ul>
      <li>Indonesian (known then as the Dutch East Indies) communist, born in Java</li>
      <li>Map of his travels: <img width="1064" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/217321336-c59d77c8-528f-4571-89c9-2c78ceff6b4e.png" /></li>
      <li>Born into an aristocratic family and learned Dutch, different European languages</li>
      <li>Becomes interested in communsim after studying in Netherlands, joins socialist teachers’ union</li>
      <li>When returning to the Dutch East Indies, he joins the PKI and is active in gaining support for it within the SI</li>
      <li>1921: Elected chairman of the PKI, arrested and exiled a year later
        <ul>
          <li>Extremely popular in the Netherlands, almost wins an election and gains support inside of the Comintern</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Advocated for the marriage of Pan-Islamism and communism in order to further their cause, especially in Asia, in a speech to the Comintern
        <ul>
          <li>Communist propaganda typically were anti-Islamic, Malaka wants them to ally with them</li>
          <li>Defends “bloc within” strategy and criticizes the Comintern’s judgemental attitude towards Islam</li>
          <li>Argues that Islam is a historically progressive religion and aligns with Christianity as an Abrahamic religion
            <ul>
              <li>Communism could extend Islam’s progressive legacy in East Asia</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Comintern is impressed with Malaka, appoints him as their representative in Indonesia</li>
      <li>1923: Malaka goes to Guangzhou, China to organize communist activities throughout Southeast Asia</li>
      <li>1925-1927: relocates to Manila, Philipines</li>
      <li>Two brutal events in 1927
        <ul>
          <li>Comintern support a PKI uprising against the Dutch to which Malaka disapproves; the uprising fails and the party effectively dies for 7 years</li>
          <li>Chinese communists are killed by the native bourgeoisie and flee to the countryside to avoid death</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Malaka breaks off with the Comintern due to his belief that it had become a vehicle for Russian foreign policy</li>
      <li>1927-1941: Malaka attempts to found communist parties throughout SE Asia before returning to Indonesia during Japan’s occupation during WWII</li>
      <li>1945-1949: Japanese are defeated, and the Dutch attempt to reestablish authority which causes a war between Indonesian nationalists and the Dutch
        <ul>
          <li>Malaka creates a left-wing faction within the independence movement, in direct conflict with right-wing revolutionaries and is executed by Indonesian authorities in 1949</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Main Points
    <ul>
      <li>The Russian Revolution created the first communist state which was meant to act as a spark for the rest of the world</li>
      <li>Failure of revolution in Europe caused the Comintern to look towards anti-colonial struggles in Asia</li>
      <li>Communism in Asia transforms the idea of communism, causes Malaka to use Islam to support the cause</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
