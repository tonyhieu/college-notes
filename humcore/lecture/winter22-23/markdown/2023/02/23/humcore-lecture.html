    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Early Life

        <ul>

  </li>
  <li>New Left, Third Worldism, Black Power
    <ul>
      <li>The 1960s saw the revival of communist ideas in the West through the New Left</li>
      <li>Causes included:
        <ul>
          <li>More diversity in higher education; students are more involved in movements for social change</li>
          <li>Anti-Vietnam War sentiment; more critique of capitalism and US imperialism</li>
          <li>The Rise of the Third World as a geopolitical force; support for anti-imperialism grows</li>
          <li>Black Power movement; Black Panther Party generalizes the black movement to the world, envisioning a struggle against imperialism and capitalism</li>
          <li>Global Maoism; the new communist, anti-hierarichal China becomes a role model for youth movements, reflects demands of the youth</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Davis in the 1960s-1970s
    <ul>
      <li>Davis is close to both the CPUSA and the Black Panther Party (BPP) but both organizations have differences
        <ul>
          <li>BPP is inspired by China and the Cuban Revolution, aims to gain power through inner-city neighborhoods and insurgency</li>
          <li>CPUSA is inspired by Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, emphasizes a mass struggle of a multi-racial working class and is suspicious of the BPP’s “adventurism”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Davis joines the CPUSA because of the Che-Lumumba (Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba) club which relates more to the black power movement</li>
      <li>1969 - hired as professor of philosophy at UCLA, conservative media is infuriated and Governor Ronald Reagan has her fired</li>
      <li>Davis hires bodyguards after receiving death threats</li>
      <li>August 1970 - one of Davis’ bodyguard attempts to free his brother from prison using a weapon registered to Davis
        <ul>
          <li>Police charge Davis with murder and attempted kidnapping which could lead to capital punishment</li>
          <li>Davis goes into hiding but is arrested in New York by the FBI after several months of hiding</li>
          <li>Stands trial in 1971 and is found innocent in 1972 by an all-white jury</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>International Solidarity
    <ul>
      <li>National United Committee to Free Angela Davis (NUCFAD) was a campaign led by communist and black power activists to raise awareness of Davis’ case and demand her release</li>
      <li>200+ US organizations and 60+ international organizations were founded around the world in support of her</li>
      <li>Communist states especially support her to present themselves as in touch with the youth
        <ul>
          <li>Russia, Cuba, Ecuador, etc. create posters in support of her</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>As a member of the CPUSA, Davis is shown as a martyr and a poster-child for communism</li>
      <li>After her aciquittal, Davis tours various communist states where she is greeted by tens of thousands of young people
        <ul>
          <li>Speaks alongisde various government officials; thanks people of the communist world for their support and struggle agaisnt imperialism and racism</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Thought of as hypocritical, as she advocated for the abolition of prison but traveled to communist states that supported the imprisonment of minorities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Crisis and Decline of the Communist World
    <ul>
      <li>1970s transforms the global economy and destabilizes the communist world
        <ul>
          <li>1973 - OPEC raises oil prices which leads to global inflation but no economic growth, also known as stagflation</li>
          <li>1979 - Volcker Shock: The Fed raises interest rates to 12% which destabilizes US dollar loans; causes countries to enter a debt crisis in the 1980s which forces them to cut social spending and sell state assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Communist and Third World states are forced to borrow heavily from international banks to cover costs during this decade, and the Volcker Shock makes their debt worse
        <ul>
          <li>Destroys the Third World as a geopolitical force and undermines the social contract of communist states (restricted in goods and freedoms but employment and basic needs are guaranteed)</li>
          <li>Life becomes harder for the population due to cuts in social spending; unable to function</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1985 - Gorbachev tries to liberalize the political and economic system but makes clear that the Soviet Union will not help to protect from internal opposition</li>
      <li>1989 - Eastern Europe states are forced to relinquish power and open to the East
        <ul>
          <li>1991 - The Soviet Union falls and the Berlin Wall is taken down</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1972 - China allies with the US against the Soviet Union, leads to capitalist reforms in 1976 led by Deng Xiaoping to reinvent their economic system</li>
      <li>Revolutionary groups like BPP and SNCC are repressed by the FBI and IRS investigations, forced to declare bankruptcy
        <ul>
          <li>By the late 1970s, most revolutionary groups in the US are extinguished and major leaders are arrested, dead, in exile, or disillusioned</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communist Response to Decline of Communism
    <ul>
      <li>Violence: in the 1970s, small revolutions occur across the globe (Red Armies, Black Liberation Army, etc) but fail to take hold</li>
      <li>New religious movements: radical countercultures turn into movements for internal spiritual renewal</li>
      <li>Domestication: communist parties dissolve and turn into green parties or moderate-left parties, abandons visions of global change</li>
      <li>Academia: attempt to teach the youth about communism to create generational change but is less practical than real change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is Left of the Communist World
    <ul>
      <li>Eastern Europe states join the EU and transitioned into global capitalism</li>
      <li>Soviet Union became capitalist and created an oligarch class due to the transfer of public wealth to private hands</li>
      <li>China is now an integral part of global apitalism</li>
      <li>Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela are crippled by US sanctions and embargoes which makes it hard to create communist world-building projects</li>
      <li>All communist states have greater social inequality as a result of communism</li>
      <li>Those who lived under communism do not wish to return to it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Davis’ Biography
    <ul>
      <li>Reflects the decline of the communist world
        <ul>
          <li>Leaves the CPUSA in 1991 after the decline of the Soviet Union and turns to academia at UCSC</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Davis’ work has inspired BLM movements</li>
      <li>Communism impacts the revolutionary ideas behind modern liberatory politics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
