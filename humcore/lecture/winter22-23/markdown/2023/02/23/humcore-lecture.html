      <li>Davis is close to both the CPUSA and the Black Panther Party (BPP) but both organizations have differences
        <ul>
          <li>BPP is inspired by China and the Cuban Revolution, aims to gain power through inner-city neighborhoods and insurgency</li>
          <li>CPUSA is inspired by Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, emphasizes a mass struggle of a multi-racial working class and is suspicious of the BPP’s “adventurism”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Davis joines the CPUSA because of the Che-Lumumba (Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba) club which relates more to the black power movement</li>

      <li>200+ US organizations and 60+ international organizations were founded around the world in support of her</li>
      <li>Communist states especially support her to present themselves as in touch with the youth
        <ul>
          <li>Russia, Cuba, Ecuador, etc. create posters in support of her</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>As a member of the CPUSA, Davis is shown as a martyr and a poster-child for communism</li>

  <li>Crisis and Decline of the Communist World
    <ul>
      <li>1970s transforms the global economy and destabilizes the communist world
        <ul>
          <li>1973 - OPEC raises oil prices which leads to global inflation but no economic growth, also known as stagflation</li>
          <li>1979 - Volcker Shock: The Fed raises interest rates to 12% which destabilizes US dollar loans; causes countries to enter a debt crisis in the 1980s which forces them to cut social spending and sell state assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Communist and Third World states are forced to borrow heavily from international banks to cover costs during this decade, and the Volcker Shock makes their debt worse
        <ul>
          <li>Destroys the Third World as a geopolitical force and undermines the social contract of communist states (restricted in goods and freedoms but employment and basic needs are guaranteed)</li>
          <li>Life becomes harder for the population due to cuts in social spending; unable to function</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1985 - Gorbachev tries to liberalize the political and economic system but makes clear that the Soviet Union will not help to protect from internal opposition</li>
      <li>1989 - Eastern Europe states are forced to relinquish power and open to the East
        <ul>
          <li>1991 - The Soviet Union falls and the Berlin Wall is taken down</li>

      </li>

      <li>Revolutionary groups like BPP and SNCC are repressed by the FBI and IRS investigations, forced to declare bankruptcy
        <ul>
          <li>By the late 1970s, most revolutionary groups in the US are extinguished and major leaders are arrested, dead, in exile, or disillusioned</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communist Response to Decline of Communism
    <ul>
      <li>Violence: in the 1970s, small revolutions occur across the globe (Red Armies, Black Liberation Army, etc) but fail to take hold</li>
      <li>New religious movements: radical countercultures turn into movements for internal spiritual renewal</li>
      <li>Domestication: communist parties dissolve and turn into green parties or moderate-left parties, abandons visions of global change</li>
      <li>Academia: attempt to teach the youth about communism to create generational change but is less practical than real change</li>
    </ul>

      <li>China is now an integral part of global apitalism</li>
      <li>Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela are crippled by US sanctions and embargoes which makes it hard to create communist world-building projects</li>
      <li>All communist states have greater social inequality as a result of communism</li>
