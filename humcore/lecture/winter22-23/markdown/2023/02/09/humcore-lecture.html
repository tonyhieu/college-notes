      <li>Spain is in a state of turmoil
        <ul>
          <li>The Popular Front (left-wing groups like communistts, socialists, etc) narrowly win elections in Spain</li>
          <li>Right-wing general Francisco Franco starts a coup against the new government, starts a civil war

  </li>
  <li>Communism and Black Radicalism (in the US)
    <ul>
      <li>The African Blood Brotherhood was a black Marxist party founded by Caribbean and African-American activists, supported communism as a means to fight against racism
        <ul>
          <li>Participated in the Comintern’s 4th Congress, emphasized the interweaving of communism with anti-racism</li>
          <li>Criticized the CPUSA for not addressing the racial question because they should attempt to unite black workers for more power</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bolshevik revolution provided minorities with cultural freedom, allowed them to have schools in their own language and practice their own traditions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CPUSA and the Great Depression
    <ul>
      <li>CPUSA membership grows during the depression, as the economic crisis seems to confirm capitalism as unviable
        <ul>
          <li>At that point, there are no economic safety nets like unemployment or Social Security, so many feel the effects of the crisis</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>1931-1940 unemployment is always above 14%, peaks at 24.5% in 1933</li>
      <li>Governments take a laissez faire approach and do nothing to let the markets sort themselves out
        <ul>
          <li>Breeds radicalism because moderate politicians who do nothing don’t get votes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Communists create solutions, such as unemployment councils to pressure the government to help and tenant associations to prevent evictions</li>
      <li><em>Dual Unionism</em>: The CPUSA separated from traditional trade unions and created its own more militant unions
        <ul>
          <li>Many US unions were corrupt, racially segregated, and ignored poorer workers</li>
          <li>Communist unions organize the lowest paid, most exploited workers together which means that workers from racial minority groups often join</li>
          <li>Extremely effective in California where a variety of migrant and seasonal workers were present</li>
          <li>In Alabama, the communists organize black sharecroppers to fight against exploitation and debt bondage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The CPUSA begins taking the issue of racism more seriously after organizing such unions
        <ul>
          <li>CPUSA creates movements for Black people such as the Scottsboro boys</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Believed that racism was key to dividing and weakening the US working class, thus allowing for the exploitation of racial minorities</li>
      <li>NAACP and CPUSA join forces to further both causes</li>
      <li>Langston Hughes creates propaganda about the benefits of communism, and many African Americans begin supporting the CPUSA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Kea’s Life Applied to Communism as a Whole: Three Worlds
    <ul>
      <li><u>Global Horizon</u>The struggle against fascism in Spain is akin to the struggle against racism in the US; fight against authoritarianism (and capitalism)
        <ul>
          <li>Victory for fascism in Spain appears to reinforce global racial hierarchies and authoritarian policies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><u>International networks</u> of communist movement allow Kea to travel from Harlem to Spain and back again</li>
      <li>The <u>communist life world</u> leads Kea to marry a Irish man while in Spain</li>
