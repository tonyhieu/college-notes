    <ul>
  <li>Paul Robeson - American singer who converted to Communism after realizing its ability to free African-Americans
    <ul>
      <li>Sang to workers at who were working on the Sydney Opera House; took a break from working on the construction to listen to him</li>
      <li>Shows power of world communism, people were allowed to openly listen and be entertained from communists</li>
      <li>Sings worldwide because he fears that the United States will revoke his passport, thus preventing him from singing again</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communism
    <ul>
      <li>Three definitions given
        <ul>
          <li>A <u>social order</u> where there is no private property, no class structure, and production focuses on social needs rather than profit</li>
          <li>A <u>political ideology</u> that wishes to overthrow capitalism and create the social order</li>
          <li>A <u>political system</u> that claim to be realizing the communist social order, such as Vietnam, China, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Governments that adopted communism address social equality, but did little to address political inequality, as governments (and their countries) were very top heavy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>The Communist Manifesto</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Published in 1848 by Marx and Engels during an era with many European revolutions; Hungarians, Czechs, French, etc.</li>
      <li>Argues that capitalism is the cause of the current chaos, as it causes economic crises and a conflict between the ruling class/wealthy (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat)
        <ul>
          <li>Market crashes are caused by a degenerate search for increased profits, and they cause the unemployment of thousands of workers</li>
          <li>Keep in mind that this occurred during the Industrial Revolution where economics was revolutionized</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Praises capitalism for its innovation and increased productivity, but discredits it for the inequality and exploitation it brought
        <ul>
          <li>Despite the increased productivity, many live in poverty, only able to live day-to-day with no owned property other than their labor</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>Manifesto</em> attempts to trask capitalism throughout history and predict where it will go</li>
      <li>Theorized that the working-class revolution would occur in the most industrially developed countries (Western Europe, North America)
        <ul>
          <li>Historically inaccurate; most successful communist movements occurred in agrarian countries with feudal relations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>History of Communism: <img width="1275" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/216409400-adcd81b4-24a9-42c6-bfcc-8d562388f42b.png" />
    <ul>
      <li>Begins with Russia trying to “ignite the spark” and create communist movements throughout Europe; unsuccessful</li>
      <li>The Communist International (Comintern) attempts to start communist movements in the East, successful in China</li>
      <li>Timeline only focuses on states but doesn’t highlight smaller movements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communist Movements in Non-Communist States
    <ul>
      <li>Italy had the largest Communist Party in Western Europe, and Indonesia had the largest Communist Party outside of USSR and China</li>
      <li>Appealed to women (equality), workers (better working cnoditions), colonized states (self-determination), minorities (racial equality), underdeveloped countries (model of economic development)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communism as World-Building
    <ul>
      <li>Global scale of ambition
        <ul>
          <li>Capitalism was the first global political-economic system, and communism would need to be global as well in order to compete</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>International networks, institutions
        <ul>
          <li>Many communist groups were created, but some of them were cultural rather than political (such as music/art groups)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Life World
        <ul>
          <li>Communism acted as a religion; communist unions, student groups, schools, etc.</li>

  </li>
