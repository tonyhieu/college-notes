  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <ul>
  <li><a href="slavevoyages.org">slavevoyages.org</a> contains information about various routes that slaves took en route to the Americas
    <ul>
      <li>Only ten million slaves survived the journey across the Atlantic; part of the Triangular Trade</li>
      <li>Most Africans went to the British colonies and Brazil</li>
      <li>The goods that were produced by slaves were materialistic and “wants”, not “needs”</li>
      <li>The idea of race was legalized in 1640 - divides slaves and Europeans into “them and us”, thus increasing the importation of slaves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Slaves were equal in terms of gender; both men and women were expected to produce goods
    <ul>
      <li>House slaves had duties such as taking care of children and sewing, and some of them created quilts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sewing">Sewing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>African-American women would sew dresses for their masters and use the remaining remnants of the cloth to create quilts</li>
  <li>CLoth was expensive at the time</li>
  <li>Parts of a quilt: quilt top, padding, and quilt bottom</li>
  <li>Though quilts were a European tradition, Africans, especially in the nation of Benin, created applique textiles which were similar
    <ul>
      <li>Men mostly worked with applique which butts heads with the tradition that women are the ones to sew</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>African-American women were forced to create quilts for their owners
    <ul>
      <li>Creating quilts out of remnants was considered creativity (making something out of nothing) and resistance (finding hope out of nothing)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Family for slaves was their slave community, not their literal blood and flesh relatives
    <ul>
      <li>Creating quilts was an act of love and rebellion to help each other to survive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Samplers were made by white women to show they were proficient at sewing and thus could perform house duties well
    <ul>
      <li>Turned into quilts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quilts were used to tell stories of the Underground Railroad as well; different quilts and icons had symbolism in a story of escaping
    <ul>
      <li>Theorized that quilts were used to show which houses were on the Underground Railroad - topic of historic contention</li>
      <li>Quilts can be thought of as a menmonic device that provides hope to slaves</li>
      <li>Many slaves ran away during the spring due to a variety of factors such as food, navigation, etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="low-country-us-slaves">Low Country US Slaves</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Gichi and Gulla cultures were cultivated on the islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia; different than most African-Americans in terms of tradition, language, culture</li>
  <li>The Low Country Region (coast of SC, GA, FL) had slaves that were mostly from the nation of Angola, as they were most experienced with farming rice
    <ul>
      <li>Contradicts the idea that slaves were not human; they in fact did have traditions and knowledge to farm rice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Slaves on the islands had a bit of autonomy; many of them spoke the same language (because they were from Angola) and slave owners disliked living on the islands because of the mosquitoes
    <ul>
      <li>Creates a structure where slaves work on the plantations while their masters are a boat ride away</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="codeswitching">Codeswitching</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Black people have to belong to two consciousnesses
    <ul>
      <li>One of them is the white idea of slaves being idiotic, incapable of thought, and subhuman in order for their masters to underestimate them</li>
      <li>The other consciousness is the reality of slaves being real humans who are capable of thinking and creating</li>
      <li>African-Americans must code switch to go between the two consciousnesses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
