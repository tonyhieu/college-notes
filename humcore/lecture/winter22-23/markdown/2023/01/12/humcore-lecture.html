  <li>Four modes of African-American artistry
    <ul>
      <li>Blues, jazz, rock and roll, and spirituals</li>
      <li>Singing songs in these genres validated white people while hiding the true struggles of African-Americans; shows ingenuity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Language of quilts used in the Underground Railroad was not written down because having evidence of such things was punishable by death, was only taught through oral history</li>
  <li>Quilts can act as portals through different migrations
    <ul>
      <li>First migration was Africans going to America as a part of the slave trade</li>
      <li>Second migration was the Great Migration, Africans moving out of the South to different regions of the country in order to find work</li>
      <li>Next migration, or portal, is to a world where African-Americans can live without racism and anti-black sentiment
        <ul>
          <li>Ties in with Afrofuturism and ideas of black people literally traveling to new worlds</li>
        </ul>
