## Chapter 4: The Market Forces of Supply and Demand

### 4-1: Markets and Competition

**What is a Market?**

- **Market**: The buyers and sellers of a good or service
    - Buyers determine demand, sellers determine demand
    - Markets can be organized or disorganized
        - Crop market is organized; sellers meet together and determine how much supply there is while buyers gather and auction for goods
        - Smaller, local markets (say, ice cream) are unorganized; ice cream stores are not in contact with each other and buyers don't meet

**What is Competition?**

- Prices are determined by the entire market, as everyone is competing with each other
- **Competitive Market**: A market with enough participants (buyers and sellers) that no one individual has a significant impact on the market
    - For this chapter, markets are assumed to be *perfectly competitive*; all sold goods are exactly the same, and there are enough buyers and sellers that no one can influence the market heavily
    - Buyers and sellers are *price takers*; they can buy and sell as much as they want <u>but only at the market price</u>
    - Easy entry and exit from the industry in the long-run
- Many markets are (nearly) perfectly competitive, but some have only one seller, leading to a *monopoly*

### 4-2: Demand

**The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded**

- **Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good/service that buyers are willing and able to purchase
    - Many factors can affect quantity demanded, but the assumed, simplified market will focus on one: price
    - **Law of Demand**: Considering everything else equal, price and demand are inverse; when price rises, demand lowers, and vice versa

    - Above table is an example of a **demand schedule**, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded
    - The graph shown is known as the **demand curve** which also shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded; typically slopes <u>downwards</u>

**Market Demand versus Individual Demand**

- *Market Demand* is the sum of all of the *individual demands* for a good or service
    - Example of creating a market demand curve from two individual demand curves: ![Screen Shot 2022-10-02 at 10 37 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/193508052-cf50193a-2076-4932-b440-cdb269ee006b.png)

**Shifts in the Demand Curve**

- Income
    - Lower income means that a demand curve falls, as there is less money to spend
    - **Normal good**: A good whose demand falls when income falls
    - **Inferior good**: A good whose demand increases when income falls (such as public transportation)
- Prices of Related Goods
    - **Substitutes**: Two or more goods that are similar enough to be affected by each otehrs prices
        - If the cost of ice cream goes down, then the demand for frozen yogurt goes down too (because froyo is more expensive and fairly similar)
    - **Complements**: Two or more goods that will go up or down in demand together depending on their prices
        - If the price of tapioca pearls lowers, then the demand for both pearls and tea will increase
- Tastes
    - Depending on your tastes, you may buy more or less of a good/service; hard to explain and unscientific
- Expectations
    - What you *expect* to happen can affect your behavior; if you think a disaster will occur, you're more willing to buy more survival goods and less willing to buy unnecessary goods
- Number of Buyers
    - Adding buyers increases demand and lowering buyers decreases demand

### 4-3: Supply

**The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied**

- **Quantity Supplied**: The amount of a good/service that sellers are willing and able to sell
    - A big determinant is price; when price of ice cream is high, the quantity supplied increases (because sellers want to make a higher profit) and vice versa
    - **Law of Supply**: Considering everything else equal, price and supply are related; when price rises, supply increases, and vice versa
    - Graphical Representation: ![Screen Shot 2022-10-02 at 10 51 48 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/193509485-e4ec2392-443a-4c98-86f4-5965dc9c48b5.png)
    - Above table is an example of a **supply schedule**, or a table that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied
    - The graph shown is known as the **supply curve** which also shows the relationship between price and quantity supply; typically slopes <u>upwards</u>

**Market Supply versus Individual Supply**

- *Market supply* is the sum of all *individual supplies*

**Shifts in the Supply Curve**

- Input Prices
    - The price of the inputs to make a good/service (ingredients, machinery, manpower) affects the quantity supplied
    - Increase in input price lowers quantity supplied and vice versa
- Technology
    - Advancements in technology increases the quantity supplied because it becomes cheaper/faster to produce
- Expectations
    - A firm that expects the popularity of a good/service to rise may produce more of it, and vice versa
- Number of sellers
    - More sellers = more quantity supplied, and vice versa

### 4-4: Supply and Demand Together

**Equilibrium**

- When a supply curve and demand curve are graphed together, there is a singular point of interception
    - That point is called the **equilibrium**, with the price representing the **equilibrium price** and the quantity representing the **equilibrium quantity**
    - Equilibrium point is in perfect balance; the quantity and price is the same that the buyers demand and the sellers supply
- Naturally, prices and quantity move towards the equilibrium point
    - If there is too much supply compared to demand, then there is a **surplus** and sellers cannot sell their goods at the current price
        - Sellers have too much supply; begin to cut prices, thus increasing demand, lowering prices, and moving towards equilibrium
    - If there is too much demand compared to supply, then there is a **shortage** and buyers cannot buy the goods they want due to a lack of availability
        - Sellers are enabled to raise prices, thus lowering demand, increasing prices, and moving towards equilibrium

- Theory of equilibrium leads to **Law of Supply and Demand**: the price of a good naturally adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded into balance

**Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium**

- Must analyze events which affect equilibriums with three steps
    - Does it change the supply curve, demand curve, or both?
    - Does it shift the curve to the left or right?
    - Compare the supply-and-demand diagrams to see how the shift affected the equilibrium point

- Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand
    - One summer, it is more hot than usual
        - Hot weather increases demand for ice cream but does not change supply curve
        - More demand shifts the demand curve to the right
        - Demand curve now meets the supply curve at a higher price and quantity

- Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves
    - In the last example, the actual supply curve didn't move; instead, the equilibrium point moved upwards along the curve
    - A shift in the supply/demand curve is called a "change" while a movement along the supply/demand curve is called a "change in the quantity supplied/demanded"

- Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply
    - One summer, a hurricane destroys a sugarcane crop, increasing the price of sugar
        - Raise in input costs leads to a reduction in the amount of ice cream produced
        - Less supply shifts the supply curve to the left
        - There is now a shortage of ice cream, and the equilibrium point moves left along the demand curve

- Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand
    - Let's say that the hot weather and hurricane occurred in the same summer
        - Both curves shift; the demand increases because of the heat, and the supply decreases because of a higher input cost
        - Demand curve shifts to the right, and supply curve shifts to the left
        - Depending on the size of the shifts, there are two possible outcomes, but both result in an increase in equilibrium price

- Discussion Notes:
    - Price typically falls on the y axis, and quantity falls on the x axis
    - Total revenue (p x q) follows a parabolic shape (goes up, plateaus, then goes down)
    - **Elasticity**: The change in price divided by the change in quantity; %deltaQ/%deltaP
        - Typically calculated using derivatives, but can use a midpoint formula
            - $$ | { {Q_2 - Q_1 \over (Q_1 + Q_2) / 2} \over {P_2 - P_1 \over (P_1 + P_2) / 2} } | $$
        - Unit elastic is when your elasticity is equal to 1; over 1 is elastic, and under 1 is inelastic
        - Goods with substitutes are usually elastic, while necessities are inelastic
        - Decrease in price of an elastic good will increase revenue, while a decrease in price of an inelastic good will decrease revenue
