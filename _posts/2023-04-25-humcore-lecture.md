title: Video Games and Worldbuilding
---

- Video games are digital games for fun
    - Anyone can play; all ethnicities, sexualities, genders, etc.
    - Game devs make games
        - AAA games are made by big development studios
        - Indies games are made by smaller teams
    - Many labor problems behind games with people not receiving due credit/pay
    - idk this stuff is kinda obvious LMFAO but i feel weird not writing anything
- These lectures will focus on video games as an art form that allow for self expression rather than a absolute "bad or good" thing
    - Video games are interdisciplinary, but we will focus on a humanistic approach to video games where we "closely read" games to find meaning
    - Game studies focus on identity and culture surrounding video games
- Worldbuilding is directly linked to video games because each game is their own world; developers have to consider how that world will be formed
    - Worldbuilding is done through environmental storytelling; written notes, personal belongings, images, etc.
