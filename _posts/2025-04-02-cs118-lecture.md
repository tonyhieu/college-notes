# Introduction
- **Formal definition**: Using *targeted behavior* in an *organism* using *artificial sensory simulation* with little or *no awareness* of the interference on the part of the organism
    - *Targeted behavior*: A man-made experience
    - *Organism*: Any organism, not just human
    - *Targeted behavior*: One or more senses are "taken over" (at least partially) by the virtual world
    - *No awareness*: "Fooled" to feel like the real world; sense of presence
    - Music, movies, and paintings can be thought of as "virtual reality" through this definition
- Defined by Immanuel Kant as the reality in someone's mind
- Jaron Lanier also defined a real world (the physical world) and a virtual world (the perceived world)
- Different terms for VR: Augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), XR, telepresence, teleoperation
- **Open Loop vs. Closed Loop**: Open loop systems don't allow for the user to interact, while closed loop systems do
- Components
    - Tracking: Input from user, looks at hand, head, body, etc. movements
    - Software: Renders and controls the virtual world
        - Maintains consistency between real world and virtual world
        - Matched zone; users should be able to walk in the real world to walk in the virtual one
        - 
    - Display: Outputs the virtual world to the user
    - The computer links all these things together
- A VR headset uses two different images for your two eyes in order to create the illusion of depth 
    - Instead of obscuring all other vision, AR uses pass-through monitors as lenses in order to project virtual objects onto the real world
    - SAR wants to get rid of any wearables (i.e. headsets) and allow for seamless merging between the virtual and real worlds
- Some challenges with VR headsets
    - **Vergence**: Headsets will cannot emulate aspects of depth; eyes will try to focus on something far away, but the screen will stay the same, causing discomfort to the user
    - **Law of Weber and Stephen**: Users will be able to physically feel a difference depending on their stimulus
        - $P=KS^n$, where $K = \frac{\text{Difference Threshold}}{\text{Standard Weight}}$ is the Weber fraction, $P$ is the perception, and $S$ is the stimulus strength
        - If $n>1$, then we have expansion; if $n<1$, we have compression
            - Electric shocks follow expansion (double the shock is more than double the pain), whereas brightnesss follows compression (double the light is less than double the brightness)
    - **McGurk Effect**: If the lip sync and audio are different, you hear something different
- Early VR headsets included stereoscopes, HMD, Nintendo's Virtual Boy

# Rendering

- Has multiple inputs
    - 3D world: objects, lights, materials, textures
    - Camera location, orientation, FoV
- Output: 2D image of the world from the camera
- Graphics Pipeline
    - Modeling: Coordinate system and objects
    - Viewing: Camera/eye, gets rid of objects not being seen
    - Illumination and shading
    - *Rasterization*: Creating a 2D image from the 3D world
    - Texture mapping
- **Triangle Soup Model**
    - Vertices have a number of attributes, such as coordinates, colors, normals
        - *Normals* define the direction a face is oriented; can be calculated by averaging the normals of the nearby vertices
    - Triangles are defined as objects that connect vertices
- Techniques
    - **Rasterization**: Project vertices from 3D onto 2D space and draw triangles between them to represent the polygons; done by the GPU
    - **Interpolation**: Automatically generating transitions between colors, frames, polygons, etc.
        - Creates interpolation coefficients by averaging out the colors/normals of nearby vertices
- Transformations
    - **Scaling**: Apply a scaling matrix, defined as $S(s_x, s_y, s_z)$ onto a point to transform it
        - Matrix has parameters on the diagonal; can be reversed using the inverse matrix, which is equivalent to $S(1/s_x, 1/s_y, 1/s_z)$
