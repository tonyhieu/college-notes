## The Employment Report

- Survey of 60k households that is released monthly, gives approximation of state of unemployment
- Gives information such as demographics, size of labor force, etc.
- Influences monetary policy decisions

## Causes of Unemployment

1. Workers change jobs: career changes, geographic preferences, want new employer, etc.
2. Firms' labor needs change: demand for firm's product changes, technology changes, etc.

- As a result, there will always be some unemployment, and this is known as **frictional unemployment**
- **Sectoral shifts** are changes in composition of demand across industries, such as the increasing demand for computers after technology got better

## Natural Rate of Unemployment

- The rate of unemployment to which the economy has a tendency to converge over time; "equilibirum rate"
    - Can vary based on recessions or booms
- Notation for rate of unemployment
    - L = # of workers in labor force (L = E + U)
    - E = # of employed workers
    - U = # of unemployed workers
    - U/L = unemployment rate
    - s = job *separation* rate: the fraction of employed workers that become separated from their jobs in a given month
    - f = job *finding* rate: the fraction of employed workers that find a job in a given month

- There are two "flows" present; sE represents workers losing jobs (E -> U) and fU represents workers finding jobs (U -> E)
- The steady-state represents the natural unemployment rate

$$
s \cdot E = f \cdot U \\
s \cdot (L - U) = f \cdot U \\
sL - sU = fU \\
sL = (s + f)U \\
\frac{U}{L} = \frac{s}{s + f}
$$

## Policies that Affect the Natural Unemployment Rate

- Policies that reduce the rate either *lower s* or *increase f*
- Lowering the natural rate of unemployment is not necessarily desirable
    - e.g. eliminating unemployment insurance does lower the unemployment rate, but it also makes quality of jobs and QoL for workers worse

### Unemployment Insurance

- Pays part of a worker's wages for a limited time after losing their job
- Increases the natural unemployment rate because it reduces f; workers are less encouraged to find work
    - Big reason why the natural unemployment rate in EU is greater than in the US; high levels of UI
- Benefits include better job matches, leading to greater productivity in the economy and higher incomes for workers

### Other Government Policies
- Government employment agencies: Provide info about job openings to match workers and jobs

## Wage Rigidity

- Wages are rigid if they are restricted from adjusting in response to changes in supply and demand 
    - Examples include minimum wage laws, union contracts, efficiency wages, etc.
- In a perfect world with flexible wages, employment will respond perfectly if wage are too high or low
- Due to wage rigidity, there will always be some people who are unemployed because wages can't change
- Downward nominal wage rigidity can lead to unemployment when there is a negative demand shock

### Minimum Wage

- One source of wage rigidity is minimum wage; the wages for some jobs become too high, so companies don't create positions for those jobs which leads to unemployment
- Minimum wage doesn't apply to most groups of workers, but it does contribute somewhat to the unemployment rate
- Difficult to find solid evidence to connect minimum wage laws to unemployment
- Some evidence that teenagers are hurt and low-wage older workers benefit

### Union Contracts

- Unions use their labor market power to get higher wages and benefits for their workers
- Unions specify wages which leads to wage rigidity
- Leads to insiders vs. outsiders problem
    - Union workers, or **insiders**, want to keep wages high
    - Unemployed non-union workers, or **outsiders**, want to get any job but can't get one because the wages are too high
- High wages lead to outsiders remaining unemployed

### Efficiency Wages

- Firms might pay its workers a higher-than-market wage
    - Reduces turnover and training costs
    - Increases worker loyalty and effort
    - Reduces shirking
- Also causes outsiders to remain unemployed because the firm cannot hire workers at the same wage

### Social Norms Against Nominal Wage Cuts

- Firms cannot cut the wages of workers due to social norms, so instead they fire them
