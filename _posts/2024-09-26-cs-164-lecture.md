## Baseline

- **Real Random Access Machine (RAM) Model** is the basis for algorithmic analysis
    - Stored program that has a memory and CPU
    - Each memory cell can store a real number; supports all data structures
    - Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in O(1) time
        - Depending on definition, can also perform more complicated ones like powers or rounding

## Convex Hull
- **Convexity**: A shape S is convex if for any two points $p, q \in S$ the line $\bar{pq}$ is covered wholly by the shape
- **Convex hull**: Any set of points that are convex and contains a set of constraining points
- Problem statement: Given n points, find a convex hull that covers the points

### Line Sweep Algorithm
- Stop at event points to form the upper and lower convex hulls separately
    - Add points to hull linearly, and if the last three points form an "incorrect turn" (i.e. a left turn for the upper hull, or a right turn for the lower hull), remove offending points
    - O(n log n) time; must sort points by x-coordinate first (O(n log n)) and then form the convex hulls linearly (O(n))
    - Start with point with the smallest x-coordinate, end with point with largest x-coordinate
        - These two are guaranteed to be on the hull

### Gift Wrapping (Jarvis March)
- Start at lowest point, draw a horizontal line of infinite length
- Look at all points to determine which one will be reached first when rotating the line
- O(hn) runtime, where h is the size of the hull
    - Each point on hull requires n comparisons to the other points

### Divide and Conquer
- Separate the set of points S into two sets, S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>
- Calculate the upper hull for S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, and then merge them by adding a bridge edge
    - No points will lie above this bridge edge, thus keeping the property of the upper hull containing all points
    - Can use binary search for a O(log n) merge step

### Quick Hull
- Select the leftmost and rightmost points in S, p and q
- Select the point furthest from $\bar{pq}$, r
- Prune all points in the triangle formed by pqr and call this algorithm on $\bar{pr}$ and $\bar{rq}$
- O(nh) runtime

### Randomized Quickhull
- Select the leftmost and rightmost points in S, p and r
- Select a random point and shoot a ray perpendicular to $\bar{pr}$
- The bridge edge (AKA edge furthest away from $\bar{pr}$) defined by points s and t will be in the convex hull
    - Add s and t to the hull
- Call randomized quickhull on $\bar{ps}$ and $\bar{tq}$
- Expected runtime is O(n log h)

## Line Segment Intersections
- Problem: Given a set S of closed line segments, return all intersections
- Calculating if two lines intersect is O(1); can use matrix operations
- Brute force: O(n<sup>2</sup>); compare all lines with each other
- Run time can be no better than O(n log n + k)
    - Element uniqueness problem can be reduced into line segment intersections, and that problem is provably O(n log n)

### Plane Sweep Algorithm
- **Cleanliness property**: all points to the left of the sweep line have been processed
- **Sweep Line Status**: store segments that currently intersect with the sweep line in order of their y-coordinate intersections
- Events
    - Points in time when sweep line status changes
        - e.g. status goes from A, B to B, A
    - Endpoints of segments
    - Intersection points
- Event handling
    - *Left endpoint*: Add segment to sweep line status, check for intersection with adjacent segments, add new intersection point(s) to queue
    - *Intersection event*: swap order of intersecting segments, check intersections of swapped segments with new adjacencies
    - *Right endpoint*: delete segment from status, check for intersections in newly adjacent segments
- Works by intersection lemma: all intersecting lines must become adjacent at some point
- Runs in O((n + k)log n), where k is the size of the output

## Doubly Connected Edge List (DCEL)
- Representation of a map
- Records each edge, face, and vertex
    - Stores geometric information, topological information, attribute information, etc
- Used for traversing all faces of a planar intersection, visiting all edges around a given vertex or face
- Main design paradigm: utilizing **half-edges**
    - Each edge borders two faces, so use two half-edges to represent one edge with both half-edges going in different directions
    - Each face's half-edges are oriented counter-clockwise, excluding the outer face
- Object information
    - Vertex stores coordinates, pointer to an incident half-edge that considers the vertex its origin
    - Face stores a pointer to one of its half-edges to begin traversal
    - Half-edge stores origin vertex, twin half-edge (half-edge that combines with this one to create a single edge), next half-edge on the boundary of the incident face, the previous edge, the face to its left (AKA incident face)
    - All of this information can be represented with functions (e.g. IncidentFace(v))
- Available operations:
    - Walk around the boundary of a given face
    - Access a face from an adjacent one
    - Visit all edges around a vertex
- With n vertices, there are <= 3n-6 edges and <= 2n-4 faces

### Computing Map Overlay
- Input: Two DCELs; Output: A DCEL that is a combination of both
    - Can use the plane sweep line intersection algorithm to construct this DCEL by finding new intersections (vertices)
    - Can use some algorithms for boolean operations: union, intersection, difference of DCELs
    - Runs in O((n + k)log n), where n is the total size of the two DCELS and k is the number of intersections

## Polygon Triangulation (Art Gallery Guarding Problem)
- Given a simple polygon P with n vertices, place a number of guards/cameras on vertices such that every point in P can be seen by some guard/camera
- NP-hard to find minimum number of guards (NP-complete for decision problem)
    - **Simple polygon**: A polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes
- Guard using triagnulations
    - **Triangulate**: Get diagonals between all vertices
    - **Triangulation**: Maximal set of non-crossing diagonals
    - Creates many triangles inside the polygon
- Simple solution: Place one guard per triangle, either in the middle of it or on a vertex
- **Theorem**: Every simple polygon has a triangulation with n-2 triangles
    - First bound: n-2 guards necessary
- 3-coloring: assign each vertex a color such that adjacent vertices have different colors
    - *Lemma*: 3-coloring is possible for vertices in a triangulation
        - Create a dual graph: vertex for each triangle, edge between traingles that share an edge
        - Max degree of 3 (3 sides), acylcic (tree)
- **Theorem**: You need the floor of n/3 guards to guard the polygon
    - Derived from 3-coloring: since each triangle has one of each color, you can choose 1 color and place guards on those vertices

### Triangulating a Polygon
- O(n log n) algorithm
    1. Split polygon into monotone polygons, O(n log n)
    2. Triangulate each monotone polygon, O(n)
- A polygon is **monotone** with respect to a line l iff for every line l' perpendicular to l is connected with P
    - x-monotone, y-monotone: monotone with respect to the x or y axis
- Can check if triangle is monotone in O(n): check upper and lower half, see if x-coordinates are increasing in values

#### Plane Sweep Algorithm
- Triangulate in O(n) time, with everything to the left of the sweep line being triangulated
    - Use left/right turns to determine when to draw triangles

### Creating Monotone Polygons
- From each vertex, shoot a ray up/down until it hits a boundary
    - AKA trapezoidal decomposition
    - Takes O(n log n) time to sweep n events, O(log n) time per event bc of binary tree
- Identify split/merge vertices as ones with two edges going the same direction
- Add diagonals to each by joining it to the polygon vertex of the trapezoid in the opposite direction of the edges
    - Both edges going left = split vertex; both going right = merge vertex

## Lower Envelope
- Problem: Given n real-valued functions, find the function f(x) that gives the minimum of all n functions; known as the **lower envelope**
    - Other parameters: s is the maximum number of intersection points between any two functions
- Assumptions
    - All functions are x-monotone
    - Function evaluation and intersection finding takes O(1)
    - Functions take constant space
- Lower envelope represented by list-like object (array, linked list); record the current function being used and the range of x-values for which it's being used

### D&C Algorithm
- Divide the set S of n functions in half into S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>
- Compute the lower envelopes L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> for S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, respectively
- Use a sweep-line algorithm to merge the lower envelopes

#### Sweep Line Merge
- Event points: All vertices of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>, all intersection points
- Queue
    - Next (right) endpoint of L<sub>1</sub> 
    - Next (right) endpoint of L<sub>2</sub> 
    - Intersection point (if it exists)
- Sweep status: y-order of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>
- Runtime is O(λ<sub>s</sub>(n) log n)
    - λ<sub>s</sub> has an upper bound of n log* n
    - log* n is defined as the number of times you have to log a number for it to be less than 1
- Inverse Ackermann function: slowest growing function possible
    - λ<sub>3</sub>(n) has an average runtime of n * α(n), where α(n) is the Inverse Ackermann function

## Linear Programming

- Problem: Optimize an objective function subject to some constraints
- **Linear program**: Defined by d variables and n constraints
- Each constraint can be considered a half-space in R<sup>d</sup>; e.g. the 2D case with lines
- The set of points satisfying all constraints is $\cap_{i=1}^{n} h_i$
- Want to maximize $f_{\vec{c}} = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{c}$, i.e. finding a point $\vec{x}$ that is extreme in the direction of $\vec{c}$

### Half-Plane Intersection
- Given a set of n half-planes in 2D, return the set of points in the interesction of the set
    - The output will be a convex polygon with at most n edges
- Can use the same method employed in the lower envelope algorithm; divide and conquer
    - O(n log n) runtime

### Incremental Linear Programming
- Assumes that the linear program is bounded and that there's a unique solution
- Add half-planes one by one and keep track of the optimal solution
- Definitions: $H_i = [h_1, h_2, ..., h_3], C_n = \cap_{i=1}^{n} h_i, v_i = \text{ Optimal vertex for } C_i$
- Lemma
    - If $v_{i-1} \in h_i$, then $v_i = v_{i-1}$
    - If $v_{i-1} \notin h_i$, then $C_i = \emptyset$ or $v_i \in l_i$, the line bounding $h_i$
- Takes O(n<sup>2</sup>) time in worst case because of the case where $v_{i-1} \notin h_i$
- Takes O(n) time on average when randomizing the input

### Seidel's Algorithm
- Randomly permute constraints
- Choose an infinity for an optimal solution
- For each constraint:
    - Check if solution point obeys new constraint
    - If not, solve the new constraint's (d-1)-dimensional linear program recursively and update optimal solution
- Exepected runtime is O(d!n) which is O(n) in lower dimensions

## Orthogonal Range Searching

- Given n points in d dimensions, query an axis algined box
    - Can report points in box, the number inside the box, etc.
    - Goal: preprocess this list into a data structure that supports fast queries

### 1D Case

- Naive: store points in an array and query by binary searching on endpoints
    - O(k + log n) runtime to list all points in query
- Better: use a balanced binary search tree
    - Store points in the leaves of tree
    - Internal nodes store copies of leaves for binary search
    - key\[x\] is the maximum key of any leaf in the left subtree
    - Faster than binary searching because you can "share" the two binary search queries up until a split node
    - Can make counting queries (i.e. how many points lie in this range) faster by storing number of nodes in subtree for each node
- BST: Space is O(n), preprocessing is O(n log n)

### Naive 2D Case

- Create a 1D binary tree for x-coordinates, and for every node, store another 1D tree for y-coordinates
- Query both trees to find all points
- Query time: $O(log^2n)$ or $O(k + log^2n)$ for reporting list of points
- Preprocessing: $O(n log n)$
- Space: O(n log n)

### Better 2D: Fractional Cascading

- [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_cascading)
- Results in O(log n) for counting queries or O(k + log n) for listing queries

### d-Dimension Case

- For each node in the d-dimension tree, add a tree for the (d-1)-dimension
- In the 2D case, use fractional cascading
- Query time is $O(log^{d-1}n)$ or $O(log^{d-1}n + k)$ depending on query type
    - log factor is saved by fractional cascading; without it would be $O(log^d n)$
- Preprocessing: $O(n log^{d-1} n)$
- Space: $O(log^{d-1}n)$

### KD tree

- Split odd layers by x-coordinate and even layers by y-coordinate in the 2D case
    - Higher dimensions will use modulo to determine which coordinate to discriminate on
- Similar to a decision tree
- O(n log n) preprocessing time
- $O(n^{1 - \frac{1}{d}})$ or $O(n^{1 - \frac{1}{d}} + k)$ query time

## Point Location

- An undirected graph is considered **planar** if it can be embedded in the plane without edge crossings
- A planar embedding induces a planar subdivision; represented by DCEL
    - Edges, faces, and vertices are all linear compared to each other; O(n)
- Problem: Given a planar subdivision, find which face a point p lies in
    - Naive: Use DCEL to check each face in O(n) time

### Slab Method

- Draw a vertical line through each point, dividing the subdivision into "slabs"
- Binary search for the slab p lies in and binary search the slab to determine the face
- $O(n^2 log n)$ preprocessing, $O(n^2)$ space, $O(log n)$ query

### Plane Sweep

- Events: Intersections and endpoints
- Status: Ordering of lines, lines are removed/added/reordered based on events
- Runtime is O(n log n), can be used to preprocess the DCEL
- *Persistent* data structures allow for queries on past versions of themselves
    - BSTs do this via path copying; never overwrite old nodes, simply create new copies
- Path copying for persistence maintains the O(n log n) runtime but extends space to O(n log n)
    - **Fat nodes**, as defined in the Sarnak and Tarjan paper, reduce space to O(n)
- Point location is done in O(log n)

### Kirkpatrick's Point Location Algorithm

- Takes traingulation as input
- Can convert a planar subdivision to a triangulation in linear time
    - Triangulate each face, maintaining label, in O(n) time
    - Turn outer face into triangle by drawing a triangle around the convex hull
- Size is O(n), conversion is O(n)

#### Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy
- Compute a sequence $T_0, ..., T_k$ of increasingly coarse triangulations
- $T_0$ is the input triangulation, $T_k$ is the outer triangle
- k is O(log n) and each triangle in $T_{i+1}$ intersects a constant number of triangles in $T_i$
- Build this sequence by deleting vertices and re-triangulating
    - Delete a constant fraction of vertices O(log n) times
    - Only delete vertices with a constant degree (≤8)
    - Choose an independent set of vertices to delete; don't delete adjacent ones
    - O(n) run time
    - Removes n/18 vertices each time; $log_{18/17} n$ steps
- Query: Store hierarchy as DAG (or tree) and path find to the corresponding triangle in $T_0$
- Complete algorithm has O(n) preprocessing, O(n) space, and O(log n) query but with large constant factors
    - O(216 log n), O(18n)


## Voronoi Diagrams

- Given a set of point sites $P = {p_1, ..., p_n} \in \R^2$
- **Voronoi cell**: $V(p_i) = \{q \in \R^2 \vert d(p_i, q) < d(p_j, q) \text{ for all } j \neq i\}$
- **Voronoi diagram**: The planar division derived from removing all V cells
- **Voronoi edges** are bisectors of points; equidistant from two points p and q
- **Voronoi vertex**: the intersection of three edges
    - Guaranteed to be the center of an empty disk defined by three sites
- Voronoi cells are convex, as they are the intersection of half planes
    - Cells have at most n-1 cells
- Number of vertices ≤ 2n - 5, Number of edges ≤ 3n - 6
- A Voronoi cell $V(p_i)$ will be unbounded if and only if $p_i$ is on the convex hull of P
- Can use non-Euclidean distance formulas

### Fortune's Sweep

- Status: "beach line"
    - Can be thought of as the lower envelope of parabolas above the sweep line
        - Parabolas are equidistant from their origin site and line
    - Intersections of parabolas will be on a Voronoi edge
- Events
    - New point (**Site Event**)
        - A new parabola must be drawn for the new point
        - Create a new Voronoi edge by tracing the intersection of parabolas
    - **Circle Event**
        - An arc shrinks to a point and disappears; "eaten up" by two other parabolas
        - Defines a Voronoi vertex
- Voronoi diagram will be stored in a DCEL
- Status will be stores in a BST
    - The tree's leaves store sitres that define the arcs above the beach line
    - Internal nodes refer to break points; intersections of arcs
- Event queue: Priority queue ordered by y-coordinate
    - New sites are stored as site events
    - Circle events
        - Store lowest point of circle
        - Store pointer to the leaf/arc in the tree that will disappear
    - Size: O(n) because there are n sites and O(n) circles
- Detecting circle events
    - Store the circles created by any three consecutive points
    - Calculate point on circle
- Handling site events
    - Locate parabola directly above new point
    - If a circle event related to the parabola exists, delete it
    - Replace the prior leaf node corresponding to the above parabola with a three-subtree containing the new point's leaf node in the middle and leaf nodes for the old point on the outside
    - Add new half-edges separated by the new breakpoints to the DCEL
    - Create new circle events with the newly consecutive points and add them if they are below the sweep line
- Handling circle events
    - Delete the point corresponding to the disappearing arc
    - Add intersection point to Voronoi diagram and add half-edges for the breakpoints
    - Check newly consecutive parabolas for circle events
- Total runtime: O(n log n)
    - Insert and delete is O(log n), O(n) events
