- Davis in the 1960s-1970s
    - Davis is close to both the CPUSA and the Black Panther Party (BPP) but both organizations have differences
        - BPP is inspired by China and the Cuban Revolution, aims to gain power through inner-city neighborhoods and insurgency
        - CPUSA is inspired by Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, emphasizes a mass struggle of a multi-racial working class and is suspicious of the BPP's "adventurism"
    - Davis joines the CPUSA because of the Che-Lumumba (Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba) club which relates more to the black power movement

        - 1979 - Volcker Shock: The Fed raises interest rates to 12% which destabilizes US dollar loans; causes countries to enter a debt crisis in the 1980s which forces them to cut social spending and sell state assets
    - Communist and Third World states are forced to borrow heavily from international banks to cover costs during this decade, and the Volcker Shock makes their debt worse
        - Destroys the Third World as a geopolitical force and undermines the social contract of communist states (restricted in goods and freedoms but employment and basic needs are guaranteed)

        - By the late 1970s, most revolutionary groups in the US are extinguished and major leaders are arrested, dead, in exile, or disillusioned
- Communist Response to Decline of Communism
    - Violence: in the 1970s, small revolutions occur across the globe (Red Armies, Black Liberation Army, etc) but fail to take hold

    - Domestication: communist parties dissolve and turn into green parties or moderate-left parties, abandons visions of global change
