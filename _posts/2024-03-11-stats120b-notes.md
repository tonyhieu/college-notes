- **i.i.d**: Independent and identically distributed (in regards to multiple distributions)
$$
\text{Mathematically, distributions } X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \text{ are i.i.d if:} \\
f_{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = f(x_1)f(x_2) \cdot ... \cdot f(x_n) \\
\text{n is the samples size, and } \bar{X_n} = \frac{1}{n} (X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) \text{ is the sample mean}
$$
