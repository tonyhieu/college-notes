title: Towards a Queer and Trans Middle Ages
---

- For pronouns of transgender monks, different manuscripts have different pronouns; scribes chose which pronouns to use
    - This leads to censoring by certain scribes that disagree with the original text
    - Women turn into men as a ways to "ascend", as women were seen as inferior to men
        - Explains why there are more trans monks vs trans nuns
- Few examples of gender affirming practices in the Middle Ages
    - Dio Cassius, *Roman History*, describes an emperor who wishes to appear as a woman but is extremely critical of the emperor
    - Medical books talk about the removal of male breasts which are a form of gender affirmation; make men look more "manly"
    - Evidence of intersex people in medical texts as well
    - Eunuchs were men who were castrated before puberty, given high ranking positions because they "lost desire" to betray the emperor
        - Described interesting, hard-working, angelic
        - Even Ethiopian (black) eunuchs were shown as white, almost transcends race boundaries
