title: Introduction: Worlds of Communism
---

- Paul Robeson - American singer who converted to Communism after realizing its ability to free African-Americans
    - Sang to workers at who were working on the Sydney Opera House; took a break from working on the construction to listen to him
    - Shows power of world communism, people were allowed to openly listen and be entertained from communists
    - Sings worldwide because he fears that the United States will revoke his passport, thus preventing him from singing again
- Communism
    - Three definitions given
        - A <u>social order</u> where there is no private property, no class structure, and production focuses on social needs rather than profit
        - A <u>political ideology</u> that wishes to overthrow capitalism and create the social order
        - A <u>political system</u> that claim to be realizing the communist social order, such as Vietnam, China, etc.
    - Governments that adopted communism address social equality, but did little to address political inequality, as governments (and their countries) were very top heavy
- *The Communist Manifesto*
    - Published in 1848 by Marx and Engels during an era with many European revolutions; Hungarians, Czechs, French, etc.
    - Argues that capitalism is the cause of the current chaos, as it causes economic crises and a conflict between the ruling class/wealthy (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat)
        - Market crashes are caused by a degenerate search for increased profits, and they cause the unemployment of thousands of workers
        - Keep in mind that this occurred during the Industrial Revolution where economics was revolutionized
    - Praises capitalism for its innovation and increased productivity, but discredits it for the inequality and exploitation it brought
        - Despite the increased productivity, many live in poverty, only able to live day-to-day with no owned property other than their labor
    - The *Manifesto* attempts to trask capitalism throughout history and predict where it will go
    - Theorized that the working-class revolution would occur in the most industrially developed countries (Western Europe, North America)
        - Historically inaccurate; most successful communist movements occurred in agrarian countries with feudal relations
- History of Communism: <img width="1275" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/216409400-adcd81b4-24a9-42c6-bfcc-8d562388f42b.png">
    - Begins with Russia trying to "ignite the spark" and create communist movements throughout Europe; unsuccessful
    - The Communist International (Comintern) attempts to start communist movements in the East, successful in China
    - Timeline only focuses on states but doesn't highlight smaller movements
- Communist Movements in Non-Communist States
    - Italy had the largest Communist Party in Western Europe, and Indonesia had the largest Communist Party outside of USSR and China
    - Appealed to women (equality), workers (better working cnoditions), colonized states (self-determination), minorities (racial equality), underdeveloped countries (model of economic development)
- Communism as World-Building
    - Global scale of ambition
        - Capitalism was the first global political-economic system, and communism would need to be global as well in order to compete
    - International networks, institutions
        - Many communist groups were created, but some of them were cultural rather than political (such as music/art groups)
    - Life World
        - Communism acted as a religion; communist unions, student groups, schools, etc.
        - Creates a community
- Communist World-Destroying
    - Various tragedies have occurred under communist regimes, resulting in the deaths of millions
