## Chapter 25: Production and Growth

- Different countries have different levels of productivity and different GDPs
- This chapter focuses on ways that these statistics can vary from country to country

### 25-1: Economic Growth Around the World

- Consider the following table: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/214708388-c73a10cf-2347-428e-955e-c0b24dae625f.png)
- Clearly, there are differences in GDP between various countries, but a few things stand out
    - *Countries don't always stay on top*: The UK was the richest country in the world but is now behind US, Canada, and Germany
    - *Countries don't always stay poor*: Japan, China, and Brazil have experienced incredible growth, taking them for poorer nations to middle-income/rich ones
- This table shows that things can vary greatly, but what drives these changes?

### 25-2: Productivity: Its Role and Determinants

**Why Productivity Is So Important**

- Consider an isolated economy that must sustain itself through its production and no foreign trade
- The higher said economy's **productivity** is, the higher its quality of life
    - More goods produced means more abundance which means free time, specialization, etc.
- Note that an economy's GDP measures both total income and total expenditure, so GDP is often a good measure of quality of life for economies
    - Higher GDP means more production

**How Productivity Is Determined**

- Different factors can affect an economy's ability to produce
- *Physical Capital*
    - Workers are more productive if given tools to work with
    - The stock of equipment and structures used to produce goods and services is called **physical capital**, or often just capital
    - Consider a bakery; the baker requires a rolling pin, baking sheets, an oven, etc. to efficiently produce baked goods
        - These factors of production are included in physical capital
    - Physical capital can also be used to create more physical capital; a miner mines ore to create nails to build a house
- *Human Capital*
    - **Human capital** refers to the knowledge and skills worker gain through education, training, and experience
    - A better quality of human capital means a higher productivity
    - Producing human capital requires labor and time, such as teachers, libraries, study, etc.
- *Natural Resources*
    - **Natural resources** refers to inputs into production that are found in nature, such as water, wood, land, etc.
        - *Renewable* resources include forests, animal husbandry, etc.
        - *Nonrenewable* resources include oil and minerals
    - Differences in natural resources are a big factor for some of the differences in productivity
        - US has great farmland, Middle East has a lot of oil, etc.
    - Some countries without many natural resources, like Japan, can thrive through international trade
- *Technological Knowledge*
    - **Technological knowledge** refers to the understanding of the most efficient ways to produce goods and services
    - Two types
        - Common knowledge, such as the invention of Henry Ford's assembly line; can be employed by everyone
        - Proprietary, such as Coca-Cola's secret recipe; often patented and only used by the company who discovered it
    - "Technological knowledge is the quality of societyâ€™s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the population has spent reading them. 

### 25-3: Economic Growth and Public Policy

- The following section details different policies governments can adopt to improve productivity

**Saving and Investment**

- Physical capital is a produced factor of production, so devoting more resources towards it can help improve future production
    - Consider a country that uses all of its labor to make food; its production remains stagnant because it doesn't improve
    - If said country used half of its labor to make tools, then in the following year, it would be able to produce more food using the new tools
- In general, saving and investment can enocourage growth and improve an economy's standard of living in the long run

**Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect**

- If a government passes a new saving rate, how long will they enjoy an increased rate of growth?
- Economists believe that (the saving of) physical capital is subject to **diminishing returns**, so the more you have, the less benefit you get from saving more
    - This property is also known as the *diminishing marginal product of capital*
    - Graph: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/214711939-5ce68189-8278-4bbe-b688-8beb127340c6.png)
- *In the long run, a higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income but no to higher growth in those areas*
    - According to economic studies, the increased growth from a higher saving rate can last for decades
- The presence of diminishing returns leads to the **catch-up effect** where smaller countries can grow at a faster rate than more established ones
    - For example, the US and South Korea both had the same saving rate in 1960, but South Korea grew by a lot more due to its smaller size
- Though the catch-up effect leads to more rapid growth, bigger countries will remain bigger because they had more capital to start with

**Investment from Abroad**

- Two types of foreign investment
    - *Foreign direct investment* occurs when a capital investment is owned and operated by a foreign entity
        - ex: Ford Motor Company creates a new factory in Mexico
    - *Foreign portfolio investment* occurs when a capital investment is owned by a foreign entity but operated by domestic residents
        - ex: said factory is run by Mexicans
    - Both types increase the stock of capital in Mexico
- Foreign investments happen because investors expect a return on their money, so the profit made from a domestic factory might be split between foreign investors and residents
    - Still, these investments increase the GDP of the country the factory is in
    - The GDP measures production and income while the GNP measures only income, so the GDP will increase by more than the GNP due to the cut investors take
- Investment from abroad is beneficial because it increases productivity and allows poorer countries to understand better technologies
- The World Bank encourages investment from abroad into underdeveloped countries to promote stability

**Education**

- Schooling can increase one's wages and standard of living considerably, so government policy encouraging schooling can increase the standard of living
- Education incurs an opportunity cost; students could have used the time spent in school working in the work force
- Some economists argue that human capital is especially important because it confers positive externalities such as the production of new technologies
- Poorer countries face the issue of *brain drain*, or the common practice of educated workers emigrating to richer ones for better wages and a higher standard of living
    - Said workers might not come back to their countries of origin to improve its GDP

**Health and Nutrition**

- Human capital can also refer to public health
- Healthier workers are more productive compared to undernourished ones
    - For instance, height has been correlated with higher productivity, and nutrition is a direct cause of height
- The link between health and wealth creates a vicious cycle; poorer nations have lower productivity and thus less healthy workers which leads to lower productivity
    - The opposite also occurs; wealthier nations have higher productivity and thus healthier workers which leads to higher productivity

**Property Rights and Political Stability**

- Production relies on the interactions between millions of individuals and firms, and the economy must coordinate said interactions through market prices
- For pricing to work, economies must have a system of property righs which encourage trade and leads to set prices
    - If property rights don't exist, then everyone would steal, thus the justice system enforces laws and contracts
- Underdeveloped countries often lack the ability to enforce property rights, leading to fraud, corruption, and crime
    - Political instability threatens the existence of property rights, as it is unclear whether or not said rights can be enforced
- Politically stable countries with good governments thus have higher productivity

**Free Trade**

- Some countries try to use *inward-oriented policies* which attempt to increase productivity through a lack of interaction with foreign countries
    - Supporters of said policies advance the infant-industry argument and are often distrusting of foreigners
- Most economists believe that poorer countries are better off using *outward-oriented policies* which can act as a sort of technology
    - If a country has an abundance of wheat and can trade that wheat for computers, they effectively have technology which turns wheat into computers
    - Countries that encourage free trade thus experience a high rate of growth equivalent to a technological advance
- Countries with inward-oriented policies must produce everything (food, textiles, technology, etc) by itself, leading to inefficiency
- Countries with seaports and easy access to trade often prosper more than countries without them

**Research and Development**

- Advances in technological knowledge is a big reason why the quality of life today is better than ever
- Technological advances often come from private firms, but said advances are, to a large extent, a *public good* that can be used by many people
- Because of this, the US government encourages the research and spread of new technologies, as seen in programs such as NASA
- The patent system encourages research and development for financial gain

**Population Growth**

- The effects of population growth have been long debated
    - Larger populations lead to more production because of the increased amount of labor
    - Larger populations lead to higher consumption which can decrease the standard of living at large
- Population growth also affects factors of production in other ways
- *Stretching Natural Resources*
    - Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outpace the production of food, thus leading to "misery and vice"
    - Malthus' theory was incorrect largely due to his failure to account for technological advances in food production
- *Diluting the Capital Stock*
    - Some theorize that high population growth reduces the GDP per worker because more workers causes capital, both physical and human, to be spread more thinly
    - This is most prevalent in poorer countries where the population growth is 3% compared to 1% in developed countries like the US
        - Some countries, like China, forced population growth down through their one-child policy
    - Income equality can encourage population growth to decrease due to the increased opportunity cost of bearing a child
- *Promoting Technological Progress*
    - The more people there are, the more geniuses, engineers, scientists, etc. there are to help improve technology
        - This theory has been supported by articles and studies in the past
        - Larger populations grow at a faster rate due to the discovery of technological advancements
