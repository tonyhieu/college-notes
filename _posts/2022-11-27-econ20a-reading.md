## Chapter 15: Monopoly

### 14-1: Why Monopolies Arise

- **Monopoly**: A firm that is the sole seller of its product which has no close substitutes
    - Caused by a *barrier to entry*; other firms cannot enter the market and compete
    - Three main barriers to entry: monopoly resources, government regulation, and production process

**Monopoly Resources**

- A monopoly can arise if a firm has sole access to a key resource
    - For example, a small town might only have one well; the owner of said well has a monopoly
    - Famous example is DeBeers, a diamond company that controls 80% of diamonds produced
- Monopolies rarely arise because of access to a key resource, as most resources are freely available

**Government-Created Monopolies**

- Monopolies can arise when the government provides one person or firm the sole ability to sell a product
    - The two most important ways the government does so is through *patent* and *copyright* laws
- Though the laws create a monopoly which is undesirable compared to a competitive market, they also encourage research and development

**Natural Monopolies**

- A **natural monopoly** occurs when a single firm can supply a good or service at a lower cost than two (or more) other firms combined
    - Naturally monopolistic companies have constant economies of scale
- Industries with natural monopolies are hard to enter; new firms cannot produce at as low of a price and compete
- Smaller markets are more condusive to natural monopolies, as the profit from competing with existing firms has a lower potential

### 15-2: How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions

**Monopoly versus Competition**

- The key difference between competitive firms and monopolies is that monopolies can control the price of the output while competitives firms (price takers) cannot
    - The demand curve for a competitive firm is elastic, as they can produce any quantity and have people buy at that price
    - The demand curve for a monopoly slopes downward, as higher quantities induce lower prices and vice versa
    - Figure: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204200418-5e8ff63a-4290-4798-854f-5b5845198895.png)

**A Monopoly's Revenue**

- Consider a water producer with the following statistics: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204200638-f6b526db-f50d-412f-9206-86db37eb2014.png)
    - Note that the *marginal revenue is always less than the price of the good*
        - This is because monopolists lose money on earlier sales while gaining revenue at the new price
        - When you go from a quantity of 3 to 4, your price drops by a dollar; you lose $3 on the original quantity while increasing revenue by the price * one unit
- When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two effects on total revenue (P x Q):
    - *The output effect*: More output is sold, so Q is higher and the total revenue increases
    - *The price effect*: The price is lower, so P is lower and the total revenue decreases
- Marginal revenue is positive when the output effect outweighs the price effect but is negative when the price effect outweighs the output effect
- Graph of Demand Marginal Revenue Curves: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204201505-9f11a95f-e580-4e3f-96ee-55e76dea0532.png)


**Profit Maximization**

- Similar to competitive firms, monopolies choose the level of production where marginal revenue equals marginal cost
    - Low quantity = lower marginal cost = increase quantity produced
    - High quantity = high marginal cost = decrease quantity produced
- Unlike competitive firms, the marginal revenue is always lower than the price
    - Competitive firms: P = MR = MC
    - Monopolies: P > MR = MC
- Therefore, to choose the price of the product, monopolies create the quantity at which MR = MC and determine the price using the demand curve
- Because the price is greater than the marginal cost for monopolies, a social cost is created

**A Monopoly's Profit**

- Similar to competitive firms:
    - Profit (P) = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC)
    - P = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q
    - P = (Price - ATC) * Q
- Graph that shows a monopoly's profit: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204202583-5ad45ae6-6fff-45fe-bdb3-61005b1f7b83.png)

**Main Steps to Maximize a Monopoly's Profit**

1. Derive the MR curve using the demand curve
2. Find the quantity at which MR = MC
3. On the demand curve, find the price that matches the quantity
4. If the price is greater than the average total cost, the monopoly profits

### 15-3: The Welfare Cost of Monopolies

**The Deadweight Loss**

- The quantity the maximizes total surplus is the found at the intersection of the supply curve (or marginal cost curve) and the demand curve
    - Figure: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204220562-1ba17cb0-a040-480c-a748-dcf5ba937138.png)
- The quantity that the monopolist chooses is the one that maximizes profit which is at the intersection of marginal revenue and marginal cost
    - Recall that marginal revenue is always lower than price (or demand)
    - Thus, *monopolies produce lower than the efficient quantity.*
    - This causes a deadweight loss because some consumers might value the price above the monopoly's cost but below its price
    - Graph: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204220814-5c13db3b-2ecb-45be-b2cf-8454da6eb6f4.png)
- The deadweight loss caused by monopolies is similar to a tax; it drives a wedge between supply and demand
    - Instead of creating revenue for the government, it creates revenue for the monopoly

**The Monopoly's Profit: A Social Cost?**

- The fact that the firm profits does not mean that there is a social cost; it simply means that producers benefit more than consumers
    - However, because monopolies produce less than is efficient, there is a social cost
- There is a caveat to this: if monopolies use their profits to maintain their monopoly, then all producer surplus is lost and the deadweight loss grows bigger

### 15-4: Price Discrimination

- **Price discrimination**: Selling the same good at different prices to different customers

**A Parable about Pricing**

- If one party values a good more than another party, then a monopoly would want to try to sell their product at a higher price to the party that values it more
    - This eliminates deadweight loss, as parties unwilling to buy a good at a higher price will buy the good at a lower one
    - Increasing the amount sold is equivalent to increasing the quantity; the inefficiency of monopolies is lessened because they produce more

**The Moral of the Story**

- Price discrimination is a rational decision to maximize profit
- To price discriminate, firms must be able to separate customers by their willingness to pay (either by geography, method of buying, etc.)
    - Adding on to this, there must be some measure in place to prevent *arbitrage*, or buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another at a higher price
- Price discrimination can raise economic welfare, as more consumers purchase the product
    - Note that all increases in surplus are producer-side; they make more profit while consumers purchase goods at their willingness to buy (resulting in zero consumer surplus)

**The Analytics of Price Discrimination**
- *Perfect price discrimination* is when a monopolist knows each customer's willingness to pay and can charge them accordingly
    - Assuming the monopolist can perfectly price discriminate, the following graphs can be made: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/204230280-72a6d7b0-7633-4790-8295-827d11d9a8f7.png)
- All marginal consumers get the product at their value, and the monopoly pockets all surplus
- Imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or not affect the total surplus in a market
    - All that is certain is that price discrimination increases the monopoly's profit, as firms would only price discriminate if there was a benefit

**Examples of Price Discrimination**
- Movie Tickets - Though the marginal cost of selling a theater seat is constant, there are discounts for kids and seniors
- Airline Prices - Depending on the timing of your flight, you might be charged more because you are a businessperson and value a flight more
- Discount Coupons - Richer people won't use coupons and stores can make a bigger profit off of them because of that
- Financial Aid - Wealthy families have a higher willingness to pay and thus don't receive aid so the college can make the most money
- Quantity Discounts - The more of a good you purchase, the lower your marginal willingness to pay is, so stores sell in bulk

### 15-5: Public Policy Towards Monopolies

**Increasing Competition with Antitrust Laws**

- If two big companies wish to merge, then the Department of Justice analyzes the deal before approving, as the union of two big companies could result in a monopoly
    - Horizontal merges are typically blocked, as they remove all competition
    - Vertical merges are allowed because it doesn't remove competition; it just makes one firm more efficient
- Laws such as the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts allow the government to prevent mergers
- Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, but mergers can also create more efficient methods of production
    - It's up to the government to decide if a merger is beneficial or not, and critics question the government's decisionmaking abilities

**Regulation**

- Governments regulate the behaviors (typically through pricing) of monopolies, usually focusing on natural monopolies like water or electricity
- The price the government sets is difficult to determine
    - A low price could cause the firm to incur a loss, forcing them to exit the industry
    - A high price (that results in zero economic profit) might not be the profit maximizing quantity for a firm, causing a deadweight loss
- A regulated price also gives the monopolist no incentive to lower their costs, as they can't make a higher profit

**Public Ownership**

- Governments have the option to run a natural monopoly itself
    - Common in European countries where the government owns telephone, water, and electric companies
    - The US runs the Postal Service
- Private monopolies are preferred to public monopolies, as private ones have an incentive to lower costs and become more efficient while public ones are slowed by the bureaucracy

**Doing Nothing**

- Policies aimed at reducing monopolies have drawbacks, and some economists argue that it is most efficient to allow monopolies to flourish
