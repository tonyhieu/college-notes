---

## Reading
- Two worlds presented
    - Cyclops island is shown as bountiful and plentiful (122-125, 129-137, 143-149)
        - Cyclops don't even need to farm; the land gives everything to them
        - Polyphemus is an intelligent cyclops who, unlike others, can herd sheep and farm well
    - Odysseus describes Cyclops as extremely unintelligent and uncivilized (118-121, 125-126, 138-141)
        - Essentially calls Cyclops "animals"
        - Cyclops are extremely gigantic and massive
            - Odysseus uses nature to describe his size (210-214, 266-274)
    
    - Odysseus's journey is filled with peril and is an uphill battle to defeat gods

- Odysseus invades Polyphemus's world; eats his sheep, drinks his wine, etc.
- Polyphemus responds by killing his men and laughing, saying that he does not fear the gods
    - Both characters show ego; Polyphemus does not fear Odysseus and his men, Odysseus says his name and makes sound while leaving
    - Both characters pay for their ego; Polyphemus loses his eye, Odysseus is cursed by Poseidon

## Lecture
- Contextualizing Odyssey 9
    - In the first four books, Odysseus is the storyteller and tells his story to the Pharacians in hopes that they give him gifts and thank them for their hospitality
    - It's a biased perspective; he wants to boast about himself
    - Odyssey 9 is part of the first four books
    - Odyssey is Odysseus trying to convince the Pharacians that he is famous and important
- Xenia: "guest-friendship" or "ritualized friendship"
    - Protected by Zeus as a tradition, comes from word *xenios*, or stranger/guest
    - 5 steps that the host must follow
        1. Invite guest in
        2. Offer them a meal
        3. Ask for their name
        4. Exchange gifts
        5. Offer them a safe escort home
- Polyphemus breaks xenia
    - Asks for name first (264) before offering a meal
    - Didn't provide a meal (324-329)
    - Promised a gift but it was ironic (413-414)
    - Doesn't provie a safe escort home (585-593)
- Odysseus punishes Polyphemus by blinding him with his club 
    - Uses Polyphemus's belongings (the club) and forming it into a weapon (the mast of a ship)
    - Uses an olive tree which is representative of Athena
    - "Now at last I thrust...breathed enormous"
    - "Hoisting high the olive stake...blazed and hissed"
    - Justifies it by asking for help from the gods 
    - Punishment is delivered by mulitple people in an organized and cooperative way
    - Drives stake into the eye in a circular motion (Cyclops = circular eye)
    - Destroying vision = removing the intellectual sense (sight = intelligence)
- Much imagery of "the last shall be first" in Odysseus's escape (482-486, 495-504)
    - Can be interpreted as "Polyphemus is stupid"
    - Odysseus wants to also show his greatness as a leader; "I let my men leave before I left"
- Odysseus goes by three names in the text: Outis (Nobody), Metis (Nobody), and Odysseus
    - Metis also means nobody, but can also mean wisdom and represents Athena's mother

- Discussing the lands and people
- Constructing the character of the cyclops
- Constructing the character of Odysseus
