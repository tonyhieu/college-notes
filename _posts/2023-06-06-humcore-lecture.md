- Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge creates an immersive experience that places the tourist into the Star Wars universe
    - Crew members cannot acknowledge the existence of Disneyland, and props in the attraction do not have any brands on them
    - Spaces cut off your line of sight to make it feel bigger
    - Inspired by architecture in Istanbul, Turkey and Marrakesh, Morocco - places that were once in the Byzantine empire
