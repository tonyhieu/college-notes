- Rhetoric - art of persuasion, focus on ethos/logos/pathos

- Creating Rhetorical Analysis
    - Look at what the words say, not at what the author or character believes/feels
        - Odysseus turns himself into the hero; what appeals does he use?
    - Can appeal to humor, power, inequality, privilege, reason, agency, gender, wealth, custom, audience, etc.
    - Think of literary devices in the context of rhetoric; is a metaphor appealing to power? danger?
    - Analyze setting, character, genre, etc. to see what the rhetorical function is

- Ethos in lines 324-340
    - Polyphemus described as inhuman, animalistic, idiotic; uses words like "maw", "ruthless", etc.
    - Odysseus describes himself and his men as intelligent but much smaller than the cyclops

- Framework Narrative: an episodic story where one part leads to another

- Think about the lecture and its relations to the text, its genre, its audience, culture, course themes, etc.
- Think about the claim a lecture is making, how the lecturer suports it, and make a new connection with it
- Write and answer discussion questions to think beyond the lecture
    - ex. In what specific ways is Polyphemus' club used in his punishment? Why is this choice important for Odysseus' story?
    - What is at stake for Odysseus in his role as story-teller to the Phaeacians?

For Tuesday: find a passage in Odyssey 9 and write a rhetorical analysis to share
    - What appeals are at work? What words in the passage/features of genre do this work explain? So what?
