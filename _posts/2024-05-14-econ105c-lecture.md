**The Zero Lower Bound**: The observation that national interest rate never falls below zero because central banks CANNOT set *nominal* interest rates much below zero
- This is because it doesn't make sense; a -5% interest rate would mean that a bank would give you $95 for every $100 you put in
- According to the Fisher equation, r = i - π, but since i >= 0, r >= -π

## The Zero Lower Bound and the MP Curve

- Because r >= -π, the MP curve is constrained and cannot go below -π, leading to a kink in the curve
- Oftentimes, this kink doesn't matter, but there are situations when the Zero Lower Bound is an issue
- There are other things the government can do aside from changing the nominal interest rate in order to improve economic conditions

## Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound

### Inflation Expectations

- The government can use inflation expectations (ex ante vs. ex post real interest rates) to do monetary policy
    - Firms use the ex ante real interest rate to do business
    - The government can use monetary policy to make expected inflation greater than actual inflation (i.e. ex ante < ex post)
    - This means that the MP curve is not as constrained if -π is lower down

#### Quantitative Easing

- The central bank can increase the monetary base to try to stimulate the economy (known as **quantitative easing**)
- Increasing the monetary base increases prices which increases inflation, thus giving the MP curve more breathing room

#### Other Methods to Increase Inflation

- Abandoning the gold standard (dollar was worth less)
- Increasing government spending

### Negative Nominal Interest Rates

- People can tolerate slightly negative nominal interest rates because the bank storing money for you acts as a service
- "Paying" for the service of storing money
- Physical money is inconvenient to store, transport, etc.

How it works:

- Central bank annoucnes a negative interest rate on electronic reserves
- Arbitrage pushes other short-term interest rates below zero

### Extraordinary Discount Window Lending

- In a financial crisis, customers want cash but banks don't have reserves
- The government gives cash loands to banks so they can give money to customers; known as **discount window lending**
    - Loans are collaterized so banks can't weasel their way out
- Remember that discount loans are seen as a sign of weakness if banks take them, but in a crisis, optics don't matter as much
