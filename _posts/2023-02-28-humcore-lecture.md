## Classical Approaches to World Building in China (3rd to 7th centuries)
- Confucianism
    - Derived from Confucius (main teacher) and Mencius (main inerpreter of Confucius)
    - Emphasizes the value of hierarchy; what keeps order is if people understand their relationship to others in terms of inferiority/superiority
        - Good hierarchies are ones where both people in the relationship owe something to each other (parent-child, teacher-student)
        - Connects to rulers: the ruler owes his population good behavior and good rule, and if the ruler is not a good ruler, then the people should rebel
    - Wants to go back to a "Golden Age" where hierarchies were clear
- Daoism/Taoism
    - Derived from Laozi and Zhuangzi
    - Skeptical of hierarchies and praises harmony, equality, etc.
        - "Do nothing and nothing will come undone"
    - Wants to go back to a Godlen Age where nature prevails
- Legalism
    - Derived from Qin Shi Huang Di (First Emperor of China 259-210 BCE)
    - The only way for a ruler to rule is to be feared
    - Does away with the notion of a Golden Age and emphasizes strict rule
    - Connects with Confucianism in the sense of hierarchies and Taoism in the sense of distrust of scholars
- Issues with this analysis of these three schools
    - Three schools of thought are considered as rivals rather than allies
    - Quintessentially Chinese traditions (such as Buddhism) are not present
    - Confucianism is thought to both support and contradict capitalism and other modern ideologies
    - Issue arises because China is thought of as relatively "changeless" when, in fact, multiple rulers controlled different Chinas at different times
- China is thought of as changeless because of its persistence to old cultural traditions; both criticized and praised for its stability
