title: Quilts as Portals
---

- [slavevoyages.org](slavevoyages.org) contains information about various routes that slaves took en route to the Americas
    - Only ten million slaves survived the journey across the Atlantic; part of the Triangular Trade
    - Most Africans went to the British colonies and Brazil
    - The goods that were produced by slaves were materialistic and "wants", not "needs"
    - The idea of race was legalized in 1640 - divides slaves and Europeans into "them and us", thus increasing the importation of slaves
- Slaves were equal in terms of gender; both men and women were expected to produce goods
    - House slaves had duties such as taking care of children and sewing, and some of them created quilts

## Sewing

- African-American women would sew dresses for their masters and use the remaining remnants of the cloth to create quilts
- CLoth was expensive at the time
- Parts of a quilt: quilt top, padding, and quilt bottom
- Though quilts were a European tradition, Africans, especially in the nation of Benin, created applique textiles which were similar
    - Men mostly worked with applique which butts heads with the tradition that women are the ones to sew
- African-American women were forced to create quilts for their owners
    - Creating quilts out of remnants was considered creativity (making something out of nothing) and resistance (finding hope out of nothing)
- Family for slaves was their slave community, not their literal blood and flesh relatives
    - Creating quilts was an act of love and rebellion to help each other to survive
- Samplers were made by white women to show they were proficient at sewing and thus could perform house duties well
    - Turned into quilts
- Quilts were used to tell stories of the Underground Railroad as well; different quilts and icons had symbolism in a story of escaping
    - Theorized that quilts were used to show which houses were on the Underground Railroad - topic of historic contention
    - Quilts can be thought of as a menmonic device that provides hope to slaves
    - Many slaves ran away during the spring due to a variety of factors such as food, navigation, etc

## Low Country US Slaves

- Gichi and Gulla cultures were cultivated on the islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia; different than most African-Americans in terms of tradition, language, culture
- The Low Country Region (coast of SC, GA, FL) had slaves that were mostly from the nation of Angola, as they were most experienced with farming rice
    - Contradicts the idea that slaves were not human; they in fact did have traditions and knowledge to farm rice
- Slaves on the islands had a bit of autonomy; many of them spoke the same language (because they were from Angola) and slave owners disliked living on the islands because of the mosquitoes
    - Creates a structure where slaves work on the plantations while their masters are a boat ride away

## Codeswitching

- Black people have to belong to two consciousnesses
    - One of them is the white idea of slaves being idiotic, incapable of thought, and subhuman in order for their masters to underestimate them
    - The other consciousness is the reality of slaves being real humans who are capable of thinking and creating
    - African-Americans must code switch to go between the two consciousnesses
