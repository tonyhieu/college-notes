- **Simple space** is a sample space where all events are equally likely; that is, for S = {1, 2, ..., N}, the probability of any event is 1/N
- The **Monte Carlo method** provides a way to approximate a probability
    - Suppose the probability of an event in an experiment is 0.6. Then, the more times you observe said experiment, the proportion of times the event occurs should get closer to 0.6.
    - If a probability is unknown, we repeat the same experiment to determine what the probability is; i.e. the Monte Carlo method
    - The method uses repeated random sampling to determine probabilities
