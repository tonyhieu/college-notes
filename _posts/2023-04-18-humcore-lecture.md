title: HTLS 2, Asianness without Asians
---

- The moments that reveal the C stories in the novel are often the most metafictional; highlights the novels connection to the real world
    - This comes in the form of the "science fictional" zones of Universe 31; Asians wish to immigrate into these zones in order to advance in society
- Charles' father
    - Charles' father is unable to advance professionally, marker of the "bamboo ceiling"
    - Mother saying "it's not fair" can either be referencing a specific event of discrimination or a general feeling of discontent
    - Neither of these quotes explitictly state that they are Asian-American, but they *imply* it
- Park Scene
    - Creates a dichotomy of "us" (Asian-Americans) vs. "them" (successful, presumably white scientists), shows that Asians are not allowed into that fantastical world
        - Charles' father vs. the director is very indicative of this, but doesn't explicitly state the race of the father and the director
    - Charles' father is upset that his career in STEM doesn't guarantee him happiness
        - STEM is thought of as objective, absolute, and a field where your merits are the only thing required to get ahead
        - Fact that Charles' father cannot advance frustrates him because it goes against the idea of STEM
    - The director is able to get ahead in the world because he understands how the world (or society as a whole) works while Charles' father is a newcomer who does not
        - Kindness of director connects with Charles as noblesse oblige, or the responsibility of the wealthy to act kindly towards the poor
    - Reveals C story of Asian-Americans, how Asian-Americans can be seen at an invisible level
- Techno-Orientalism
    - Stemmed from the idea that Asians were technologically advanced and could succeed in a postwar world, especially the Japanese
        - "The future is now Japanese too... Japan is the future"
        - Japan panic, idea that the Japanese would take over, akin to the yellow peril
