title: Blurring the Digital and 'Real' Worlds

- The Magic Circle
    - The magic circle is how games, sports, stage, screen, etc. are separate from the real world
    - The game is separate from the real world, and though it's defined by rules from the real world, the two have a definite boundary

    - Real life still affects video games, and video games affect real life
- Games as More Than Fun
    - Stating that games are "just for fun" can be harmful; implies that games don't have cultural or artistic value and mature, serious people shouldn't play them
        - Can also be used to discount video games analysis and almost insult those who over-analyze games + point out heteronormativity and issues in games
- Empire@Play Article
    - Games are very much real because they influence and are influenced by reality
    - "Real" factors
        - Real money - billion dollar international industry, economies exist in virtual worlds
        - Real inequality - video games are inaccessible to many who are poorer or don't have access to internet
        - Real labor issues - crunch time, stressed developers, unequal pay
        - Real effects on the environment - metal for hardware is bad for the environment, waste of energy, finished video games are wasted
    - Games can be used for protest to push against the concept of the "Empire" as the tools for game-making have evolved
- Serious Games
    - Designed by small studios, educational organizations, nonprofits, etc.
    - Adress real social issues through translating problems into game mechanics and environment
    - Turns serious issues into fun, game-like elements
    - Aim to promote awareness or empathy for an issue, as games can be used for social good
    - Serious games do bad AND good; they promote acceptance and shifts pre-existing paradigms, but they also spur appropriation, oversimplification, and focus too much on privileged players
    - Questions to ask about serious games
        - Who is making the game, and is the author someone with first-hand experience with the subject?
        - Who is represented in the game, and who is determining the accuracy of the game?
        - Who is the audience for the game, and who benefits from it?
