## 8 Great Ideas of Organization

1. Moore's Law: Processing power doubles every few years
2. Use **abstraction** to simplify design; divide big problems into smaller ones
3. Make the **common case** fast because the common case will be used very often
4. Increase performance via **parallelism**; do multiple things at once
5. Increase performance via **pipelining**; make use of all stages and steps whenever possible
6. Increase performance via **prediction**
7. Implement a hierarchy of **memories**
8. Increase dependability via **redundancy**

## Von Neumann Architecture

- Much of modern computer architecture is based on Von Neumann Architecture
    - Separate CPU and RAM
    - Binary instructions and program data in MIPS are stored within the RAM

- Instructions are run in a Fetch - Decode - Execute cycle
    - All of thise stored in the memory

## Differences in Architecture

- **RISC Architecture**
    - Reduced Instruction Set Computers
    - Wanted to provide a minimal set of instructions that covered all necessary operations
        - Few, simple instructtions with fixed size and short execution time
        - Explicit load and store instructions for memory
    - Examples include MIPS, LC3, PowerPC, SPARC 
- **CISC Architecture**
    - Complex Instruction Set Computers
    - Wanted to add more instructions so that programs used a smaller amount of instructions, thus reducing memory usage
        - Multiple operations per instruction
        - Many memory-related instructions
        - More information is used for each instruction due to instructions of variable length
    Examples include x86

## Memory in Architecture
- Memory is divided into cells with each cell having an address
    - Words are 32 bits
    - Memory is byte-addressable (can access in 8 bit / 1 byte increments)
