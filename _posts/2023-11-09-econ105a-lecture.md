## Supply-Side Chapter

- **Technology**: A process by which inputs are converted to an output
- Instead of consumption bundles, suppliers handle *input bundles*, where x<sub>i</sub> denotes the amount used of input i
    - Like consupmtion bundles, input bundles can be written as vectors of input levels: (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>i</sub>)
- **Production functions** states the maximum amount of output possible from an input bundle
    - Production functions can take on one or many parameters to define the level of output
    - Note that any value BELOW the production function is also attainable; you can output less than the maximum, but never more
- **Production plans** are tuples that include an input bundle and an output level
    - Production plans take on the following form: (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>, y)
- **Technology Sets** define the collection of all feasible production plans

$$
\text{A technology set, T, is defined as the following:}\\
T = \{(x_1, x_2, ..., y) | y \leq f(x_1, ..., x_n), x_1 \geq 0, ..., x_n \geq 0, y \geq 0\} \\
\text{where f is the production function.}
$$

- Production plans which lie on the production function are called *technically efficient plans*, as they maximize the output according to a given input bundle
    - Plans below the production function are *technically inefficient plans*
