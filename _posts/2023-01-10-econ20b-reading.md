## Chapter 23: Measuring a Nation's Income

- **Macroeconomics**: the study of the economy as a whole; includes factors such as inflation, unemployment, etc.
- **Microeconomics**: the study of how individual firms and households interact with each other in a free market
- Following chapters will focus on macroeconomics and statistics that provide information about the well-being of the entire economy

### 23-1: The Economy’s Income and Expenditure

- Can judge how a nation (or person) is doing based on the income of the people in that economy
- Gross domestic product (GDP) allows economists to measure income; tracks the total income and total expenditure of an economy
    - Note that *for an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure*
    - If someone pays $100 for a service, then one party gains $100 and one party spends $100; GDP raises by $100 as a whole
- The circular flow diagram is a good representation of GDP
    - All of the green arrows in the figure below represent money and, therefore, changes in GDP

### 23-2: The Measurement of GDP

- **Gross domestic product (GDP)**: the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time
    - Definition has many aspects

**"GDP is the market value..."**

- The GDP measures market prices to reflect the value of goods sold and purchased

**"...of all..."**

- The GDP attempts to measure the market value of every single good sold or purchased in an economy
    - Housing is measured by the rental price of the home or, if the house is not being rented, the estimated rental price of the home
- The GDP does not measure illegal products, such as drugs, or products manufactured and consumed in homes, such as a backyard tomato garden
    - This can lead to situations where a marriage can lower a GDP if a consumer and producer get married

**"...final..."**

- Goods can either be intermediate or final
    - *Intermediate goods* are used in the process of making a final good; think the corn used in making a tortilla
    - *Final goods* are the end product of a production process; the tortilla
    - GDP only measures the value of final, not intermediate goods
- The GDP does measure intermediate goods if it is added to an inventory for use at a later time
    - Essentially, additions to an inventory add to the GDP, and when those additions are used at a later time, they are subtracted from the GDP

**"...goods and services..."**

- Both goods (food, books, video games, etc) and services (haircuts, car wash, concerts, etc.) are included in a GDP

**"...produced..."**

- GDP only includes goods and services *currently* produced, not ones produced in the past
    - If a car manufacturer creates a car, the value of that car is added to the GDP
    - If someone sells an old car to someone else, the valur of that car is not added to the GDP

**"...within a country..."**

- The GDP measures the production inside of the geographical boundaries of a country, regardless of the citizenship or nationality of the producer

**"...in a given period of time."**

- The GDP measures the value of production in an interval of time, which is typically either a financial quarter or year
    - Reporting for a GDP for a quarter is typically multiplied by 4 to represent an "annual rate"
    - Quarterly GDP data is typically adjusted in order to account for seasonal changes, such as shopping sprees in December
- With these clarifications, the definition of GDP has multiple layers
    - Theoretically, the GDP should be equal to the gross domestic income (GDI), but the difference in GDP and GDI can be chalked up to a *statistical discrepancy*

### 23-3: The Components of GDP

- The GDP can be understood as a sum of four different types of spending
- Y = C + I + G + NX
    - Y represents GDP
    - C represents consumption
    - I represents investment
    - G represents government purchases
    - NX represents net exports

**Consumption**

- **Consumption** is spending by households (aka citizens/regular people) on goods and services
    - Does not include housing purchases, as those count as an investment
    - Services include haircuts and medical care, and goods include food, clothing, appliances, etc.

**Investment**

- **Investment** includes the purchase of goods (known as *capital goods*) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services
- Includes business capital, residential capital, and inventories/stock
    - Business capital: business structures (like factories), equipment, and intellectual property products (software or recipes)
    - Residential capital: buildings for rent, personal residences
    - Inventory: components, ingredients, intermediate goods
- Investment, in this case, does not refer to financial investments such as stocks and bonds; it refers to goods that will be used in the future to create more goods and services

**Government Purchases**

- **Government purchases** includes spending on goods and services by all types of governments
    - Includes salaries of government workers and expenditure on public works
    - Known officially as *government consumption expenditure and gross investment* but known traditionally as *government purchases*
- Social Security benefits or unemployment is not considered part of government purchases; they are instead defined as *transfer payments*
    - These are not specified as expenditures because no value is being extracted from the production of goods or services; thus, they are not part of the GDP

**Net Exports**

- **Net exports** = exports - imports
- Net refers to the subtraction of imports from exports in order to show the amount exported
    - Selling a domestic product to a foreign buyer increases GDP, while purchasing a foreign product domestically decreases it

### 23-4: Real versus Nominal GDP

- If total spending rises from year to year, either a) more goods and services were produced or b) the price of goods increased
    - To measure quantity of goods instead of a change in price, economists use *real GDP* which uses a market price baseline of a set year

**A Numerical Example**

- Example table of an economy which produces hot dogs and hamburgers: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/212288137-0f759446-6639-45b1-816d-4bbe325e0be3.png)
- The total expenditure can be simply found by multiplying the current market price by the current quantity of goods sold
    - The production of goods and services valued at current prices is called the **nominal GDP**
    - In the table, the nominal GDP for hot dogs and hamburgers continually increases, but this increase can be attributed ot both the increase in price and the increase in production
- **Real GDP** removes the issue of price changes by valuing goods and services at a set price based on a previous year
    - Using 2019 as the base year, we can calculate the value of goods and services using the 2019 market price in order to account for any changes in price
    - For the base year, the real GDP will always equal the nominal GDP
- *Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services.*
- Real GDP is a better measurement of economic well-being because it consistently tracks the level of production between years; real GDP is used to determine economy growth

**The GDP Deflator**

- The GDP Deflator is calculated as follows:
    - $$ | { GDP Deflator = {Nominal GDP \over Real GDP} * 100 } | $$
- This equation allows us to see how the prices of goods and services have changed compared to the base year
    - If the prices remain the same from the base to current year, then the GDP deflator remains constant
    - If the prices increase or decrease from the base year, then the GDP deflator will also increase or decrease accordingly

### 23-5: Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic Well-Being?

- GDP tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy, and in most cases, this tells us about the economic well-being of the average person (more expenditure = more money = happier)
- Some disagree that GDP is a good measure of economic well-being, as it does not measure any intangibles such as happiness, bravery, creativity, etc.
    - GDP, though not directly connected, can indirectly measure these traits
    - More GDP = more education, better nutrition, more specialization for a country
- GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being
    - Production can unnaturally increase (everyone begins working every day of the week), thus increasing GDP but decreasing well-being
    - Does not include goods and services produced at home, such as a chef's home-cooked meals, volunteer work, or the work of stay-at-home parents
    - Does not measure environmental factors, such as pollution
    - Does not measure distribution of income; a nation with 100 people making $50k has the same GDP as a nation with 1 person making $5 million and 99 people making $0
- In general, GDP is a good measure of well-being for most, but not all, purposes
