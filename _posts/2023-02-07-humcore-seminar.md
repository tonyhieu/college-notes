## Symbols

- Clothing
    - Stripped of clothing = stripped of power, especially for women who are being objectified
    - Deguerreotypes and scientific photography were particularly racist because they analyzed the Black body by stripping it and looking for differences
        - Ties to idea of polygenesis, or the idea that different races are of different species, thus reinforcing a racial hierarchy
    - More clothing implies control over one's image, self-determination
