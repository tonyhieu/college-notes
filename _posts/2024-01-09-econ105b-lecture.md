# Cost Minimization

- Recall that the average cost of goods is minimized when MC = AC
- Must minimize cost before trying to maximize profit
- Note that in the long run, there are no fixed costs, so AC = AVC

## Demand Curves and Market Structures

- Maximizing profit comes with constraints
    - *Technological constraints* refer to the ability to produce some maximum amount of output
    - *Market constraints* refer to the demand curve a firm faces
        - Monopolies (1 firm markets) face a downward sloping demand curve
        - Perfect competition (many firms in a market) face a static, horizontal demand curve
        - Oligopoplies (few firm markets) are in the middle

## Competitive Equilibrium

$$
\text{Competitive firms attempt to maximize } \pi (q) = pq - c(q) \\
\text{First order condition: } \pi '(q^*) = p - c'(q^*) = 0 \\
\text{Second order condition: } \pi ''(q^*) = -c''(q^*) \leq 0 \rightarrow c''(q^*) \geq 0 \\
\text{Thus, the profit maximizing quantity occurs when } p - c'(q^*) = 0
$$

### Competitive Firm Short-Run

$$
\text{In the short run, there are fixed costs, so } \pi = pq - c(q, k') \text{ where k represents the fixed value.} \\
\text{The firm will thus choose q such that } \pi = p - c_s ' = 0 \text{ and } -c_s '' \leq 0 
$$

- Note that a firm can still make a loss despite profit maximizing

$$
\text{A firm will NOT shut down if it can cover its variable costs; that is:} \\
pq^* \geq c_v (q^*) \rightarrow p \geq AVC
$$

### Short-Run Supply Function of Competitive Market

$$
\text{The quantity supplied by a competitive market is given as the horizontal summation of firms' supply functions:} \\
Q_S = \sum q_i
$$

Q<sub>S</sub> is inaccurate because of the *input-price effect*; the result of all firms expanding output would cause all of their input prices to rise higher. Thus, the industry's short-run supply curve is *less* elastic than the individual firms' supply curves

### Competitive Firm Long-Run

$$
\text{In the long run, there are no fixed costs, so the profit maximizing quantity satisfies the following:} \\
\pi '(q^*) = p - c_l' = 0 \\
\pi ''(q^*) = -c_l'' \leq 0 \\
\text{Additionally, the long-run no-shutdown condition must be satisfied:} \\
p \geq min\{\text{Long-Run Average Cost}\}
$$

### Industry Supply in the Long Run

- You can use horizontal summation on individual firms' supply curve to find the industry supply curve
- *Exit-entry effect*: In the long-run equilibrium, every firm belonging to the industry must make nonnegative economic profits
    - Positive economic profits cause firms to enter the industry
- Assumption: The elasticity of supply is greater in the long run than in the short run, as firms can more easily enter/exit from the market
- Assumption: In the long run, economic profit for any firm in a competitive equilibrium must equal 0

### Competitive Long vs. Short Run

If a firm perceives a change to be permanent, then it will make gradual changes; otherwise, it will make more drastic ones to capitalize

### Benefits of Exchange Under Perfect Competition

Because trade is mutually beneficial, the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized under a competitive market.

The overall surplus can be hindered by government policies, such as taxes or supply quotas.
