title: Writing Empathy
---

- In the science fiction world, the *Parable* is a novum
    - Incorporates new aspects of science fiction
    - Many "strange" aspects of the reality in the *Parable*; Lauren's hyperempathy is unrealistic but has roots in reality
        - Lauren gets hyperempathy due to her mother taking drugs while pregnant
        - Bankole suggests that hyperempathy might be a good thing, as people would be hesitant to hurt others
- Drugs in *Parable*
    - Many of the characters are directly affected by drugs
        - Either their family took drugs and got addicted or were hurt by drug addicts
    - Pyro, or "Ro", causes people to commit arson and murder
    - The paints are another group of people who murder others, especially the rich
    - Lauren's mother takes Paracetco which acts as a performance enhancer; increases positive traits and minimizes negative ones
    - Drugs act as a form of escapism from the harsh reality of the *Parable*
    - During Butler's time, drugs were newly used and uncommon
        - Drug use was emphasized in *Parable* to create the dystopia; an extreme version of her reality
- Neoliberalism
    - The most prevalent form of political theory currently
    - Accepts that there is a free market and asserts that each person is responsible for themselves and must "play" in the free market
        - Everything is economized, every entity is governed as a firm, humans are nothing but market actors
    - Because neoliberalisms values competition and the free market, social welfare goes into decline
        - The 20th century saw the erosion of social welfare into free market policies
    - The *Parable of the Sower* takes capitalism to an extreme
        - Commodities are rare (rather than luxuries) and jobs are few because people are naturally greedy and take more than they should have
        - Basic necessities now have markets: food, water, shelter
        - Government agencies such as police and firefighters only service the highest bidder
        - The paints described in the book literally kill the rich because they are disillusioned with income disparity
- Hyperempathy
    - Acts as a foil to drugs; instead of numbing or escaping reality, the condition forces one to closely examine it
    - How does the world become the one in *Parable*? Where are the people who care?
        - Hyperempaths therefore have the power to change the world, seen in *Parable of the Talents*
    - Butler wants people to become more empathetic ("make people feel") and uses hyperempathy as a vehicle to do so
- Butler's writing attempts to encourage others to build a new world where people are more empathetic and caring
    - Linked the Republic, Decameron, etc. because both encourage the telling of stories to better society
    - Acknowledges that hyperempathy isn't always a good thing, but some progress can go a long way
