title: Disneyland and Automation
---

- History of the Word "Automation"
    - First used to describe the assembly line and factories
        - Provides higher quality of life, more efficacy, more mass leisure
        - Less work needed, promises of 30 hour work week among other things
    - Automation then started being used for military purposes; aiming for anti-air missiles, etc.
    - After automation became widespread, philosophers feared machines replacing humans and overtaking them
        - Focused on the idea of feedback loops/control with input and output
        - General Electric released multiple short, animated films that highlighted the benefits of automation
- Automation as Imagineering
    - Many of the lead creatives in Disney had backgrounds in industrial engineering and automation
    - "Imagineering" was first coined in recruitment advertisements for Alcoa Aluminum, an industrial company
    - Disney was one of the first parks to use automation (sensors to trigger events) while many other parks use mechanization instead (on/off buttons, unintelligent rides)
        - Rides can be thought of as an assembly line in of itself
        - Automated tramrails and trains were used as a model for various dark rides like Peter Pan
        - Very similar to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, no machines and everything is hidden
- Personified Automation
    - Robots are often personified to make them feel more "real"
    - Used to make robots less intimidating (or, in the case of Disney, to simulate an experience)
