- Xuan Juliana Wang
    - Born in China but emigrated to LA in 1992
    - Grew up reading Danielle Steel and John Grisham; got her BA at USC, MFA at Columbia, and Stegner Fellow at Stanford
    - Wrote *Home Remedies* and teaches creative writing at UCLA
    - Focuses more on Asian heritage than American assimilation, as seen in her introduction of being from China instead of LA
    - Took computer science course to better understand her family
    - Both have very similar styles as a response to their lived experiences as Asian-Americans; C story
- Ted Chiang
    - Born 1967 in New York, son to a Mech E Professor at SUNY Stony Brooke
    - Got a BA in CS, very much a result of hyperselectivity
    - Worked as a technical writer for Microsoft
    - Most of his work does not directly reference racial or national origin markers
    - Wrote a very few number of stories for his tenure but has a high award-to-publication ratio
- The Two Cultures
    - Arts vs. Sciences is the main divide in cultures, and Asian-Americanssare more concentrated on STEM fields instead of artistic fields
    - Arts are luxury, lack of success, no money while science is practical, technical, intelligent
    - The two cultures are at odds with each other, and the conception of the two cultures stemmed from the non-communication between arts and science faculties
        - Coined by C. P. Snow in order to resolve the Cold War
    - Universities shifted more from arts to sciences in order to keep up with the Soviets during the Cold War, and Asian immigrants were crucial to do so
- Ethnographic Imperative
    - Used to dtalk about how minority groups often feel pressured to express themselves as those minority groups
    - Roger Ebert: "Why do Asian Americans have to make a movie specifically about Asian Americans? They shouldn't!"
    - Solution is to stylize an A story into a B story; morph your true beliefs and experiences into a generalized form
- Asian-American literature
    - Much of Asian-American literature was not fiction; mostly considered biographies or memoirs
    - Emphasizes the idea of the ethnographic imperative, more assimilationist than creative
    - Important to note that this is not the fault of the author or publisher; it's the fault of society as a whole and the pressures of the ethnographic imperative
    - In the 1990s, Asian-American writers began winning literary awards due to the children of post-65 immigrants growing up and writing novels
        - This also leads to a boom in Asian-American science fiction stories
- Stories can be put into A and B stories, where B stories are things that are actually in the text (characters, plot, imagery. etc.) while A stories are the contexts behind the texts (such as history, genre, author, etc)
    - The A story of *Algorithmic* is explicitly Asian-American while the B story of *Story* is what reveals the Asian-American aspect
- Story of Your Life
    - Strictly science fiction, but still has many of the aspects of the post-65 Asian American culture
    - Two cultures conflict
        - The daughter wants to be a financial analyst, but mother is a linguist who was "meant to be" an English teacher
        - The mother is more emotional and understanding compared to Gary
        - Freedom vs. Determinism: ethnographic imperative states taht Asian-Americans MUST talk about the Asian-American experience (representing determinism), while simultaneous consciousness does not (representing freedom)
- Algorithmic Problem Solving For Father-Daughter Relationships by Wang
    - Science fictional; computer science is the lens that the character views the world
    - Many of Wang's stories are expansive and include people of various wealth, education, etc.
    - Wendy vs. her father; daughter talks about her love for wine while her father is more practical and cannot understand her, highlights the idea of two cultures
    - Highlights deprofessionalization, the father had to give up his prestige and honor to move to the  (A story)
