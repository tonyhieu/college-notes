- Goal of Earthseed is to go to space; "take root among the stars"
    - Lauren is questioned/mocked for her beliefs, and Butler doesn't hesitate to show how it seems ridiculous
    - Why the stars?
        - Relates to colonization, slavery
        - Science fiction often discusses exploration, discovery, and colonization
            - Relates to time period: imperialism, empire
- What does colonization look like from a non-European perspective?
    - Implied in HG Wells' *The War of the Worlds*, how do people (specifically Europeans) react to colonization?
    - Utopia / dystopia / heterotopia
        - Heterotopia is a space where people can do things differently; alter reality, space, time, society, etc.
    - Afrofuturism: moving into a heterotopic space where people of color are in power, a new world where the power dynamic is different
- Afrofuturists sometimes use technology in order to create these new spaces where people of color have power
    - Sun Ra used synthesizers, science fiction as a medium to imagine these worlds
        - Space is the Place takes place on a different planet, black people are able to live a better life
    - Relates to separatism, or reverse colonization, where marginalized people become de-marginalized through new worlds
- Afrofuturists focus on the Atlantic slave trade
    - Leaving Africa was already "the apocalypse" and going into slavery was the dystopia
    - Going to a better place would therefore "fix" the dystopia
    - Some music and stories propose a world where the babies of pregnant slaves thrown overboard grow up underwater and thrive
- Wants to challenge white history and colonization and prophesize a new future 
- How do histories of racism/slavery induce futures of power?

- When the expectations of gutters, straight lines, etc are broken, some emotional response is meant to be elicited
