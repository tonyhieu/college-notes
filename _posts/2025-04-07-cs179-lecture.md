# Intro

- **Mutual Information**: $I(X; Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X, Y)$
- **KL Divergence**: $D(p \vert\vert q) = \sum p(x) \log\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$
    - Measures similarity between distributions
    - 0 if equal
    - Asymmetric
- **Copula Models**: Generates a multivariate model with unpopular marginal probabilities by using a change of variables to convert the original model to a Gaussian model
    - Used in economics; **normalizing flows** is more popular in machine learning
