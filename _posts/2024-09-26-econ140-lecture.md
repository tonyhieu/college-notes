## Elasticities

- To maximize total revenue, we want elasticity to be unitary
    - Without demand function, we have to predict the optimal price via elasticities
- **Elasticity**: $e_p = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \cdot \frac{p_0}{q_0} = \frac{\partial logQ}{\partial logP}$
    - Keep guessing until \|e<sub>p</sub>\| = 1
    - If \|e<sub>p</sub>\| > 1, decrease price; if \|e<sub>p</sub>\| < 1, increase price
- **Heterogeneity**: Different (groups of) consumers have different demand curves and different optimal prices
    - Can use either uniform pricing (less profit) or price discrimination (more profit)
    - The elasticities of demand can affect your pricing strategy
        - Less elastic = more room to play with; more elastic = less room to play with
- Goal of firm is to maximize producer surplus (equal to profit if there is no fixed cost)
    - Depends on demand (unknown) and supply curve (cost)
    - This class will **not** focus on fixed costs; the total cost will be made up of variable costs
        - $MC = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q}$
- Demand can be elastic for two reasons
    - Product has low valuation: price increases, people stop buying
    - Competitive market, many substitutes
    - To alleviate elasticity elasticity and increase market power, firms use **product differentiation**
        - **Vertical differentiation**: Changes in quality
        - **Horizontal differentiation**: Changes in superficial features
- In the long run, goods become more elastic because it's easier to substitute in the long run
- Can calculate demand function from elasticities (assuming D has a constant slope)
    - $e_p = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \cdot \frac{P}{Q} = \text{Slope} \cdot \frac{P}{Q}$
    - Plug this slope into Q = mP + b
    - Can only do this if the firm is a price maker; can change price and affect demand
        - Implies high market power
    - Quirk: When demand is straight line, you can double the slope (of P = mQ + b) to get marginal revenue
- **Midpoint elasticity**: $e_p^{mid} = \frac{\Delta Q}{q_1 - q_0} \cdot \frac{p_1 - p_0}{\Delta P}$

### Income Elasticity
- **Income elasticity**: $\frac{\% \Delta Q_d}{\% \Delta I} = \frac{\partial log Q_d}{\partial log I}$
    - Income is positive for *normal goods* and negative for *inferior goods*
        - Normal goods: coffee, games
        - Inferior goods: canned soup, instant ramen
    - **Quasi-linear** preferences have an income elasticity of 0
        - Includes necessities like salt or toothpaste
    - Normal goods include *luxury goods* (e > 1) and *Veblens goods* (upwards sloping demand curve)
        - Veblens goods include status-indicating goods, such as jewelry and designer brands
    - Inferior goods include *Giffen goods* (upwards sloping demand curve)
        - Giffen goods are driven by poverty; income effect dominates the substitution effect

### Cross Price Elasticity
- **Cross price elasticity**: $\frac{\partial log Q_A}{\partial log P_B}$
    - If e = 0, goods are unrelated, as $\Delta Q_A = 0$, so $P_B$ doesn't affect it
    - If e > 0, A and B are substitutes; when the price of B goes up, the quantity demanded of A goes up because it is cheaper
    - If e < 0, A and B are substitutes; when the price of B goes up, the quantity demanded of A goes down because it's consumed in conjunction with B

## Market Power

- Factors that affect market power
    - Number of firms
        - Consumers have more options (substitutes)
        - Demand becomes more elastic
    - Consumer preference; value of market
        - Low value implies willingness-to-pay is low
- Shifts to demand caused by above factors
    - Number of firms
        - Lower consumer base implies an inward shift, and more substitutes implies a higher elasticity
    - Invaluable market
        - Low willingness-to-pay implies high elasticity
- Linking market power to elasticity
    - **Market power**: ability to set P above MC
    - **Learner index**: $LE = \frac{P - MC}{P}$
    - Range of Learner index: 0 <= LE <= 1
        - LE = 0: Perfect competition
        - LE > 0: Firms have some market power
        - LE = 1: Monopoly or dominant firm
- Higher market power (P - MC) means lower elasticity of demand

## Price Discrimination
- Two types of consumer base
    - *Homogenous*: All consumers are the same or are indistinguishable
    - *Heterogenous*: Consumers differ by income, preferences, etc.
- If homogenous, use a uniform pricing strategy
- If heterogenous, have to ask if resale can be prevented? If it can, price discriminate
- Different types of price discrimination: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
    - 1st: Offer different prices to individual consumers
    - 2nd: Product versioning; offer different prices for different versions of products
    - 3rd: Offer different prices to different groups
    - 1st is always preferred
- Welfare is measured by the sum of consumer surplus and profit
- **Two part pricing strategy**: Charging an entrance fee (fixed) and a user fee (variable based on preferences)
- **Bundling pricing**: Offering items in a bundle
    - *Pure bundling*: Must buy all items of a bundle
    - *Mixed bundling*: Can buy whole bundle or single items at a higher cost

## Advertising and Marketing

- Benefits of advertising
    - Can increase willingness-to-pay which increases the slope, easier to raise prices
    - Can increase consumer base which means demand shifts outwards
    - Create awareness
    - Reduce search costs by giving hard information
    - Differentiate product(s)
    - Brand loyalty; can lead to higher market power
- **Advertising**: Increasing awareness about a product
    - *Informative advertising*: Based on objectivity
    - *Persuasive advertising*: Based on subjectivity
- **Marketing**: Initiating conversations about a product for brand loyalty
    - *Inbound Marketing*: Consumers come to you to discuss your product
    - *Outbound Marketing*: You go to consumers to discuss your product
- **ROAS**: Return on ad spend, calculated as revenue produced by ads divided by amount spent on ads
- Two types of information in ads
    - **Hard information**: Direct details about a product; price, qualities, etc
    - **Soft information**: Indirect details about a product; signalling


## Formulas

- Total Revenue
    - $TR = P(Q)Q \rightarrow MR = \frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} Q + P = P[\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} \cdot \frac{Q}{P} + 1] = P[\frac{1}{e_p} + 1]$
- Marginal Cost
    - Revenue maximized when MR = MC
    - $MC = P[\frac{1}{e_p} + 1] \rightarrow \frac{MC}{P} = \frac{1}{e_p} + 1 \rightarrow \frac{P - MC}{P} = - \frac{1}{e_p} \rightarrow LE = - \frac{1}{e_p}$
- Percent change in demand
    - Factors: Price, income, preferences, price of related goods, expectations
    - $Q^d = f(P, I, P^R) \rightarrow dQ^d = \frac{\partial f}{\partial P} dP + \frac{\partial f}{\partial I} dI + \frac{\partial f}{\partial P^R} dP^R$
    - Implies $\% \Delta Q^d = e_P \% \Delta P + e_I \% \Delta I + e_{AB} \% \Delta P^R$
