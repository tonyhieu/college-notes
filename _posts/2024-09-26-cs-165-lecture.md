## Sorts

### Shell Sort
- A generalized version of insertion sort
- Takes in parameter of g, where g is the gap between swaps
    - For example: if g = 5, then every fifth element should be sorted with each other
    - Insertion sort is the case where g = 1

### Hybrid Sort
- Same as merge sort, but once the size of the split arrays becomes small enough, run insertion sort
- Motivation: insertion sort works best with small lists, and the merge paradigm doesn't work as well when there aren't many elements

## Randomness

- Donald Knuth's definition of randomness: Each element is chosen randomly and independently from a distribution
- Various sources of randomness
    - Radioactive decay
    - Radio noise
    - Hardware noise
    - If any of these sources are truly random, then it can be XOR'd with non-random sources to create a truly random outcome

### Skew Correction
- Method of creating a random number
- Choose two bits, discard if they are identical, use the first if they are not
    - Analogous to flipping a coin repeatedly
    - Computationally intensive
- Keep generating random numbers until they fall into your desired range

### Pseudorandom Number Generators
- Mimics the properties of randomness without the computational load
- Important property: the output should not be determinable from previous outputs
    - Known as being **cryptographically strong**
    - Various hashing algorithms are known to be cryptographically strong, such as SHA-1 and MD5

#### Linear Congruent Generator (LCG)
- Parameters
    - x<sub>0</sub>: start term
    - P<sub>1</sub>: coefficient
    - P<sub>2</sub>: intercept
    - N: modulo term
- Equation: x<sub>n+1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub>x<sub>n</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> (mod N)
- Flawed because the sequence generated from an LCG will eventually repeat

### Generating Random Sequences

#### Radix Sort
- Assign elements in a list a random, large number
- Sort these elements according to their assignments; creates a random permutation

#### Fisher Yates
- O(n) algorithm to randomly permute an array

```
for k = n - 1 down to 1:
    j = random(k+1)
    swap arr[k] and arr[j]
```

## Bin Packing
- Problem: pack items of weights 0 <= w<sub>i</sub> <= 1 into bins with a capacity of 1 and find the minimum number of bins needed
- NP-hard problem
- Different than knapsack: trying to find smallest number of bins as opposed to most value
- Metrics exist to determine how good a solution can be
    - **Approximation Ratio (AR)**: Approximated Solution / Optimal Solution
    - **Waste**: Waste = Number of Bins - Sum of Item Weights

### Next-Fit (NF)
- Check to see if item fits in the current bin
    - If it does, place it there; if not, move to the next bin
- AR will be no worse than 2

### First-Fit (FF)
- Scan bins in order and place the new item in the first (leftmost) bin that can hold it
    - Create a new bin if it doesn't fit anywhere
- Can use a balanced binary tree to store bins to get an O(n log n) run time for the algorithm
    - Use bin-index as the primary key, and store the maximum capacity available to determine if you can go left/right
- AR is no worse than the ceiling of 1.7m

### Best-Fit (BF)
- Same as FF, but leftmost restriction doesn't apply
- Binary search on bins for best-match capacity left; O(n log n)
- After adding an item to a bin, you can delete the node and re-insert it with its new capacity

### FFD and BFD
- Sort the items from largest to smallest first, then run FF or BF, respectively
