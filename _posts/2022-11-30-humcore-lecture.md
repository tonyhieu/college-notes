title: Parable's Rhetorical Circulations
---

- The main goal of media is to send a message and garner emotion; rhetoric
    - The Obama Hope Poster was a form of rhetorical circulation, or a piece of rhetoric that is spread out amongst the public
    - A rhetorically circulated piece might be picked up and repurposed into a different movement
- A paraliterary approach is one where readers read things at face level instead of reading deeply; reading for pleasure
    - Very different than literary analysis
    - Provides a sense of comfort, surface level empathy
- Lauren's character takes inspiration from Butler; they both read whatever they could get their hands on and extrapolate
- Butler's vision for the Parable series was to make the third book more hopeful, create a better world
    - Shows that the first two were meant to show the evil of humanity while the third was to show the hope of it
- Adrienne Maree Brown misreads Parable of the Sower; takes Earthseed and tries to develop it in a way that Lauren would not have (because Lauren is not hopeful)
- Some people have tried to create their own Earthseed communities, shows impact of the book
