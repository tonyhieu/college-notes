    - Spain is in a state of turmoil
        - The Popular Front (left-wing groups like communistts, socialists, etc) narrowly win elections in Spain
        - Right-wing general Francisco Franco starts a coup against the new government, starts a civil war
            - Government organizes workers to fight for them, Franco controls the military
            - Italy and Germany support Franco, Russia supports the Republican government
            - Republicans have the support of 35,000 foreign volunteers, many of them communist, and becomes a global symbol of fighting against fascism
    - Kea supports the Republican cause and travels to Spain to work on the front lines
- Communism and Black Radicalism (in the US)
    - The African Blood Brotherhood was a black Marxist party founded by Caribbean and African-American activists, supported communism as a means to fight against racism
        - Participated in the Comintern's 4th Congress, emphasized the interweaving of communism with anti-racism
        - Criticized the CPUSA for not addressing the racial question because they should attempt to unite black workers for more power
    - Bolshevik revolution provided minorities with cultural freedom, allowed them to have schools in their own language and practice their own traditions
- CPUSA and the Great Depression
    - CPUSA membership grows during the depression, as the economic crisis seems to confirm capitalism as unviable
        - At that point, there are no economic safety nets like unemployment or Social Security, so many feel the effects of the crisis
    - 1931-1940 unemployment is always above 14%, peaks at 24.5% in 1933
    - Governments take a laissez faire approach and do nothing to let the markets sort themselves out
        - Breeds radicalism because moderate politicians who do nothing don't get votes
    - Communists create solutions, such as unemployment councils to pressure the government to help and tenant associations to prevent evictions
    - *Dual Unionism*: The CPUSA separated from traditional trade unions and created its own more militant unions
        - Many US unions were corrupt, racially segregated, and ignored poorer workers
        - Communist unions organize the lowest paid, most exploited workers together which means that workers from racial minority groups often join
        - Extremely effective in California where a variety of migrant and seasonal workers were present
        - In Alabama, the communists organize black sharecroppers to fight against exploitation and debt bondage
    - The CPUSA begins taking the issue of racism more seriously after organizing such unions
        - CPUSA creates movements for Black people such as the Scottsboro boys
    - Believed that racism was key to dividing and weakening the US working class, thus allowing for the exploitation of racial minorities
    - NAACP and CPUSA join forces to further both causes
    - Langston Hughes creates propaganda about the benefits of communism, and many African Americans begin supporting the CPUSA
- Kea's Life Applied to Communism as a Whole: Three Worlds
    - <u>Global Horizon</u>The struggle against fascism in Spain is akin to the struggle against racism in the US; fight against authoritarianism (and capitalism)
        - Victory for fascism in Spain appears to reinforce global racial hierarchies and authoritarian policies
    - <u>International networks</u> of communist movement allow Kea to travel from Harlem to Spain and back again
    - The <u>communist life world</u> leads Kea to marry a Irish man while in Spain
