    - Rebellion: most of China is unaffected but major changes at the top, typically spurred by violence and extremely rapid
        - Akin to revolutions in Europe such as France and America, typically establishes a new dynasty
    - Revolution: change felt in all parts of society which usually involves violence, most famous cases are 1911 and 1949
        - Akin to the ideas of Marx and Engels in the upheaval of the class and political systems
    - Reform: gradual, nonviolent change that is not extreme
    - Restoration: return to how things used to be and usually non-violent, can either be slow or fast
