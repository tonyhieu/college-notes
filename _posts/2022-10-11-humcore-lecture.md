- What is the Cave
    - Contained in Book 7, 514a-517c
    - Acts as an allegory to generalize human existence
    - Socrates imagines the cave, which is reflective of the lowest part of the divided line
    - Supposition - what *would* happen if a prisoner *should* be freed? A "world less vivid"
- The topography of the cave
    - Underground cave with prisoners and free inhabitants
    - Entrance is very far up, has light and is as wide as the cave
    - Lit by a large fire above and behind the prisoners
    - On *higher ground*, a path stretches between the prisoners and the fire
        - Puppets are shown on this path above a low wall, and the shadows are shown to the prisoners
- The cave as vertical stratification of space

| Levels | 
| Test |
| Exit/Entrance |
| Fire burning above the low wall which lights the Cave and reveals puppet shadows |
| The low wall and path on which puppets are shown |
| Prisoners who watch the shadows on the wall in front of them and hearing echoes |

- The cave-dwellers
    - Prisoners
        - Humans who have lived in the cave their whole lives, cannot move their bodies at all and can only see in front of them
        - Can tell the difference between different shadows and sounds
        - Can name shadows and discern patterns in their presentation
        - No self-perception or perception of those around them
        - Shadows talk if puppeteers talk
    - Puppeteers
        - Also humans with an ambiguous motivation, carry artifacts to show shadows
        - Some speak, some are silent
            - Speakers only do so to make sound effects
- The release of the One & its painful effects
    - One prisoner must stand up, turn his head, walk, and look up towards the light (all physical verbs)
        - Beginning of enlightenment is to turn the head
    - The One would be pained, dazzled, and unable to see the objects that cast the shadows (puppets)
    - He would be at a loss if he learned that the objects were more real than the shadows themselves
    - His eyes would hurt if he looked at the fire, and he would want to turn back
    - He'd be pained if he wanted to walk up
    - After escaping, he wouldn't be able to see the things outside of the cave
- The forceful liberator
    - Someone/something <u>suddenly compels</u> a prisoner to stand up
        - "Suddenly" breaks the structure and flow of the time perceived in the cave
    - The prisoner would be at a loss if *we* <u>compelled</u> the prisoner, someone <u>compels</u> the prisoner to look at the light
        - Notice use of we vs. someone; someone is ambiguous and unknown, uncertain
        - The liberator is unknown and a wild variable that breaks the highly structured world of the Cave
    - Someone drags the prisoner using force and doesn't stop dragging him until he has reached the sunlight
- Cave, Line, & Sun
    - Visible Realm
        - Inside the cave/lower line
        - Involves shadows - reflections, shadows, illusions -> any images (Level 1 of the Line)
        - "To see, to believe"
        - Puppets -> physical objects (Level 2 of the Line)
        - Fire allows objects to be seen
    - Intellectual Realm
        - Shadows, images of men and other things in water -> Mathematics and hypotheticals (Level 3 of the Line)
            - "To see"
            - Not yet in the outside world of the Cave
        - Things themselves (things in the sky, night time objects) -> Forms (level 4 of the Line)
            - "To see, to study"
            - Leave the cave
        - The sun, provides light and therefore intelligence to mankind -> The Good
            - "To see, to study, to infer, to include"
- Why do we need the Cave if we have the Line?
    - The Line is a geometric figure, while the Cave is a story about humanity
    - The Line implies continuity and progress between the lower and upper line, while the Cave implies a sharp divide between outside and inside the Cave
    - In the lower line, belief is "automatic" and comes after they see physical objects, while in the cave, belief is difficult and requires effort
    - The Line makes transitions from one part to another seem smooth, while in the Cave each transition requires an external force which comepls
- Back to the Cave
    - A released prisoner coming back to the cave would not be able to see in the cave; too dark
    - If they talked to the perpetual prisoners, they would be ridiculed
    - Other prisoners would say that the released prisoner would have ruined their eyesight and that the journey up was worthless
    - If they tried to free the chained prisoners, they would be killed
