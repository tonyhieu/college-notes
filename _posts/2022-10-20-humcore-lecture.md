- Decameron was one of the first pieces of Italian literature
    - Written around 1350 and rewritten in the 1370s
    - Founding, major piece in Italian literature and prose
    - Was praised in its time but also banned for being obscene later
- Contains one hundred tales over ten days told by seven women and three men (a group called a brigata)
    - The group escaped Florence after the Plague, and they spend their time telling stories

- Leaping and linking from the ancient texts to the *Decameron*
    - The other texts that we've read (Odyssey, Plato, Virgil) spanned two thousand years before the *Decameron*
    - Bocaccio lived 1300 years after Virgil and 2400 after Homer
    - Bocaccio read Virgil's works in Latin, but he did not read (but knew about) Homer and Plato because he didn't know Greek
        - The translation and recuperation of ancient Greek and Roman knowledge drove the Italian Renaissance
        - Bocaccio + Petrarch were its first proponents
- *Decameron* Keywords; words to think about and consider
    - compassion
    - humanity
    - intelligence
    - reason
    - love
    - wit
    - beauty
    - laughter
    - youth
    - honor/honorable/honest
- Bocaccio versus the "Author"
    - Bocaccio
        - Had an intelligent father but was illegitimate
        - Went to law school, learned a lot about literature
        - Friends with Petrarch
        - Controls the book
    - The Author
        - The voice who states that he wrote the book
        - Representation of Bocaccio
- The "Author" in recovery from lovesickness
    - Author states that he was in pain because of love
    - Shows appreciation for his friends because they helped him through it
    - Wants to help others get through lovesickness
- The *Decameron*'s addressees
    - At the time of writing, lovesickness was a big issue for Bocaccio's contemporaries
    - Arts, medical literature, etc. were created to describe it
    - Bocaccio wishes to address women who often don't have an outlet to express their lovesicknesses
        - Signals philogyny, or love of women
- Ways of seeing the *Decameron*'s frame: Worlds and Tales
    - The frame gives the book as a whole a "complex, stylistic, semantic, and ideological coherence"
    - The macrostructure of the frame supports the microstructures of the individual novellas and tales
    - The novellas are ordered precisely and acquire meaning through their placement in the frame
    - Each tale builds its own world, whether it be from the Author or each one of the characters

- Frame as binding mechanism
    - Bocaccio defends his work using the Author as a character in different parts of the book, such as the introductions and conclusions (Outer Frame)
        - Wanted to build a literary tradition in Italian
        - Establish secular literature as an art form
        - State that world-building and play are essential human activities
        - Celebrate Florence nad its culture
    - Author's narration of the "main story"
        - Describing the brigata, introducing each day, etc.
        - Transitions between stories, reactions to stories
        - Describing the background
        - Keeps names of storytellers anonymous to protect their reputation; names are representative of their personalities
    - Novellas inside of the main story
        - Storytellers tell 100 stories with different themes and ideas
    - Characters in the novellas tell tales
        - Inside of the story, a character might tell a story
        - Characters act as surrogates for their real-world counterparts
- The plague: a horrific but necessary beginning
    - Reference to Dante and how he brings the reader through hell before starting
    - Thinks of it as a necessary evil
    - Boccacio's description uses medical and historical sources; is very accurate
    - Humans didn't understand the Plague's origins and its consequences
    - Killed 30-60% of Europe's population and originated from the East, likely from China
    - Many different responses to the plague: isolation, make merry and live each day as its last, quarantine in groups, adopt a minimalist lifestyle
    - Brigata leaves town, justifies the decision based on natural rights
    - Almost everyone who lived in their households either died or fled
    - Led to social breakdown
    - Many social and familial bonds broke, social expectations degenerated
    - All human industry is destroyed; Bocaccio asks, "where have all these thiings gone?" (ubi sunt?)
- The political world of Florence and the political structure set up by the storytellers
    - Florentine Republic - an oligarchy that was ruled by the elite
    - Rose and fell in power, was temporarily replaced by signories, or a de facto principality (single ruler)
    - In the brigata, the members are all equal
        - Ruled by a monarchy where the ruler rotates every day
    - Bocaccio relates the historical aspects of Florence to the Decameron
- The pastoral *locus amoenus*
    - Pastoral setting, brigata lives in a villa with gardens
    - Each garden acts as a locus amoenus which is a safe space
- A separate space for literary world building
    - Chaos of the "real world" plague vs. the order of the villa and stories
