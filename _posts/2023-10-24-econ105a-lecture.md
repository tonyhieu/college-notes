## Demand Chapter

### Own-Price Changes

$$
\text{How does } x_1^* (p_1, p_2, y) \text{ change as } p_1 \text{ changes, holding } p_2 \text{ and } y \text{ constant?} \\
\text{Suppose } p_1 \text{ increases from } p'_1 \text{ to } p'_2 \text{ to } p'_3
$$

The following graphic has two curves. The curve containing all the utility maximizing bundles as p<sub>1</sub> changes with p<sub>2</sub> and y constant is the **p<sub>1</sub> price offer curve**. The other graph plotting the x<sub>1</sub> coordinate of the p<sub>1</sub> price offer curve against p<sub>1</sub> is the demand curve for good 1.

As the graph shows, the more that p<sub>1</sub> increases, the optimal amounts of good 1 and good 2 decrease. This is because the budget set becomes increasingly smaller. 

#### Perfect Complements

The p<sub>1</sub> price offer curve for a perfect utility function would be a straight line in the form of x<sub>2</sub> = ax<sub>1</sub>, as the bundles on that line will always be chosen as optimal bundles. The demand curve would have an x-intercept at y/p<sub>2</sub> and no vertical intercept.

$$
\text{Assuming that a = 1, the optimal amounts of goods 1 and 2 are: } \\
x_1^* (p_1, p_2, y) = x_2^* (p_1, p_2, y) = \frac{y}{p_1 + p_2} \\
\text{As } x_1 \rightarrow 0, x_1^* = x_2^* \rightarrow \frac{y}{p_2} \\
\text{As } x_1 \rightarrow \infty, x_1^* = x_2^* \rightarrow 0 \\
$$

#### Perfect Substitutes

The optimal amounts of the goods are given by the following:

$$
x_1^* (p_1, p_2, y) =
\left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        0, & \text{if } p_1 > p_2\\
        y / p_1, & \text{if } p_1 < p_2
    \end{array}
\right\} \\
x_2^* (p_1, p_2, y) =
\left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        0, & \text{if } p_1 < p_2\\
        y / p_2, & \text{if } p_1 > p_2
    \end{array}
\right\} \\
$$

- The price offer curve has three pieces; when p1 > p2, p1 == p2, and p1 < p2
    - Note how the p1 < p2 case resembles the Cobb-Douglas indifference curve; this is because you are buying x1 such that x1p1 = y, which is the same as the Cobb-Douglas curves
