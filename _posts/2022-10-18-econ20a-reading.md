## Chapter 7: Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets

- **Welfare Economics**: The study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being
    - Answers questions about how to best organize economic activity

### 7-1: Consumer Surplus

**Willingness to pay**

- **Willingness to pay**: The maximum amount a buyer will pay for a good; represents what a buyer values a good at
- Consider the following scenario where four people want to buy an album:

| Buyer | Willingness to Pay |
| --- | --- |
| Taylor | 100 |
| Carrie | 80 |
| Rihanna | 70 |
| Gaga | 50 |

- In an auction, the price would raise to 80$, and Taylor would buy it at 80$ or more (because Carrie is unwilling to pay more)
    - Taylor's **consumer surplus** is her willingness to pay minus the price she paid
    - If there are two albums to sell, then both Taylor and Carrie receive a consumer surplus, and the total market consumer surplus rises

**Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus**

- Can use the demand schedule shown above to create a demand curve
    - Price is represented by the *marginal buyer*, or the buyer that would leave if the price was raised

    - Depending on the quantity, the price of the album drops according to each buyer's willingness to pay
    - *The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market.*

- Demand curve represents maximum willingness to pay

**How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus**

- At lower prices, the price of the good is lower than more consumers' value of the good, thus leading to a higher consumer surpus

**What Does Consumer Surplus Measure?**

- Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being from the perspective of the buyers, as they are getting good value
- Consumer surplus can sometimes be ignored in a market; lowering the price of heroine is not good but would increase consumer surplus

### 7-2: Producer Surplus

**Cost and the Willingness to Sell**

- **Cost**: The value of everything (resources, manpower, time) that a seller uses to produce a good, essentially equivalent to willingness to sell
- Consider the following scenario where four sellers are competing to paint a house:

| Seller | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Vincent | 900 |
| Claude | 800 |
| Pablo | 600 |
| Andy | 500 |

- In an auction, the price would start high and quickly lower to 500$; Andy would offer a price of 600$ or slightly lower and take the job (because Pablo is unwilling to sell for lower than 600$)
    - Andy's **consumer surplus** is the price he sells his service at minus his cost of production
    - If there are two houses to paint, then Pablo and Andy will both receive a producer surplus, and the total market producer surplus rises

**Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus**

- Can use the supply schedule shown above to create a supply curve
    - Price is represented by the *marginal seller*, or the seller that would leave if the price was lowered

    - Depending on the quantity, the price of the service raises according to each seller's cost
    - *The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market.*
    - Graph: ![Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 11 08 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196595776-d430ae67-f796-4596-a8c1-eb83f9d809fd.png)

**How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus**

- A higher price increases producer surplus because more producers get a higher profit margin for their service

### 7-3: Market Efficiency

**The Benevolent Social Planner**

- Consider a dictator who wants to maximize economic well-being in society
- Can calculate *total surplus* in a market by adding consumer and producer surplus
    - Total surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers = Buyers' willingness to pay - Sellers' cost
- An allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus <u>exhibits **efficiency**</u>
    - Inefficient allocations include ones where producers are, wastefully, having higher costs to produce or ones where goods aren't consumed by buyers who value them the most
- **Equality**: Whether buyers and sellers both have similar levels of economics well-being
- Thinking of the market as a pie, efficiency attempts to make the pie as big as possible while equality attempts to split it evenly

**Evaluating the Market Equilibrium**

- At the equilibrium, the buyers who value the good the most and the sellers who have the lowest cost both consume/produce the good; therefore, the market equilibrium represents the greatest total surplus
    - Graph: ![Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 19 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/196596765-3aecf1c5-0a26-4f16-96d5-702b9573462c.png)
- Free markets also naturally produce the quantity of goods which maximize total surplus; reducing the quantity creates a shortage, while increasing the quantity creates a surplus

- The benevolent dictator need not intervene; the invisible hand of the market will do everything for them
