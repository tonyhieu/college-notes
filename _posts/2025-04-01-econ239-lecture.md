# Week 1

- **Behavioral finance** studies the intersection between finance and psychology
    - How do biases, emotions, social factors affect financial decision making?
- Uses the rational actor model as a baseline + studies deviations from this actor

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

- **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Markets are considered efficient if the price of assets reflect all available information; old information is "stale" and useless
    - *Weak Form Efficiency*: All past market prices and data are fully reflected in current market prices, implies that technical analysis (studying past data) cannot outperform the market
    - *Semi-strong Form Efficiency*: All public information (not just past asset prices) is completely reflected in asset prices, implies that fundamental analysis (earnings calls, news) cannot outperform the market
    - *Strong Form Efficiency*: All information (even insider info) is accounted for in stock prices, implies that insiders cannot outperform the market
- Because you can't outperform the market via fundamental or technical analysis, active management strategies are not better than passive index funds
- Diversification is crucial in minimizing risk
- Minimizing trading costs is crucial to limit costs and maximize returns

## Deviations from EMH

- Behavioral finance argues that asset prices deviate from their EMH values because of psychology and irrational traders (AKA noise traders)
    - An argument against this is that arbitrageurs (AKA rational traders) will quickly correct this noise via calls or puts
    - A counterargument states that arbitrage responses can be costly and risky, and noise traders do not deviate randomly but instead deviate together
- Delong et. al (1990) showed that noise traders and rational traders can coexist

## Testing the EMH

- **Random Walk Model**: Fama (1965) tests whether stocks move randomly, proving weak form efficiency since you cannot predict prices based on past prices
- **Event Study Methodology**: Fama (1969) analyzed the stock price reaction to fundamental events (earnings calls, mergers) to see how quickly and accurately information is priced into the price of an asset
- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: Assesses expected returns based on an asset's risk, examining whether markets reward higher risk with higher returns
- **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)**: Uses different risk factors to explain stock returns
- **Fama-French Three (or Four) Factor Model**: Extends CAPM by including size and value factors, testing if tthese additional factors predict returns better than CAPM
    - The fourth factor comes from Carhart and is known as the "momentum factor"

## Pricing Models via EMH

### Present Value

- Under the EMH, the market price of an asset equals its present value ($PV$)
- $PV = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{CF_t}{(1+\delta)^t}$
    - $CF_t$ represents the cash flow in a period t, such as dividends or interest
    - $\delta$ is the discount rate (usually the risk-free interest rate)
    - $n$ is the number of periods, and $n=\infty$ for an indefinite horizon
- If $PV > P_t$, then the asset is undervalued; if $PV < P_t$, then the asset is overvalued

### CAPM

- Riskier stocks should be worth more since they aren't as safe
- The risk on a risky market portfolio is given by ${E[R_m] = R_f + \text{ Equity risk premium}}$
    - $R_m$ is the average market return and $R_f$ is the risk free rate (usually the yield on a 1 year U.S. treasury bill)
- The equity risk premium can be calculated by $R_m - R_f$
- Expected stock $i$ returns: $E[R_i] = R_f + \beta_i(E[R_m] - R_f)$
    - $\beta_i = \frac{Cov(R_i, R_m)}{Var(R_m)}$
- $\beta < 0$ means that the stock moves opposite against the market (gold)
- $\beta < 1$ means that the stock is less volatile than the market (Walmart)
- $\beta = 1$ means that the stock mirrors market performance
- $\beta > 1$ means that the stock is more volatile than the market
- Model falters for high $\beta$ values

#### Efficiency Measures 

- *Risk Premium*: $E[R_i] - R_f$
- **Lintner's Ratio**: $\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{\beta_i}$, should equal 1 if CAPM is right
- **Sharpe Ratio**: $\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{\sigma_i}$
    - The Sharpe ratio should be constant, as CAPM assumes $\sigma_i$ is proportionate to $\beta_i$
- **Jensen's Alpha**: Should equal 0 if CAPM is right
- Studies have shown that Jensen's Alpha is positive in portfolios with higher $\beta$

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

- Model: $E[R_i] = R_f + \gamma_{1,i}F_1 + \cdots + \gamma_{n,i}F_n$
    - $F_i$ are firm specific factors
- APT assumes less about investor behavior and market conditions
- Generalizes CAPM; adds more factors aside from just $\beta$

### Fama-French Factor Model

- Uses specific factors as opposed to generalized ones
- Four factor model
    - $R_M - R_f$: Market risk premium
    - $SMB$ (Small Minus Big): Size premium captures the excess returns of small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks
    - $HML$ (High Minus Low): Value premium captures the excess returns of high book-to-market stocks over low book-to-market stocks
    - $RMB$ (Robust Minus Weak): Profitability premium, captures the excess returns of stocks with robust operating profitability over stocks with weak profitability
    - Fifth factor, $CMA$ (Conservative Minus Aggressive): Investment premium, captures the excess of returns of firms with conservative vs. aggressive investment strategies

## Markovitz Mean-Variance Approach

- The **mean-variance** rule allows investors to minimize risk and become "rational"
    - Investment decisions should be determined by the mean and variance
    - If same mean, choose stock with lower variance
    - If same variance, choose stock with higher mean
- Falters when the choice is between two stocks where one has both a higher mean and a higher variance
- Rule is only appropriate when returns are normally distributed and agents have quadratic utility functions

## Expected Utility Theory (EUT)

- Von Neumann and Morgenstern's axioms of rationality are used to define the EUT, the leading theory of decision-making under risk
- Axioms
    - *Completeness*: Every pair of alternatives can be compared
    - *Transitivity*: Preferences are consistent across choices
    - *Continuity*: Preference between lotteries should not change abruptly with small changes in probability
        - If $A\succeq B \succeq C$, there exists $p,q\in [0,1]$ such that $pA+ (1-pC)\succeq B \succeq qA + (1-q)C$
    - *Independence*: Consistency of preferences between lotteries regardless of a common third prospect
        - If $A\succeq B$, then $pA + (1-p)C \succeq pB + (1-p)C$ for some $p\in [0,1]$
- If the axioms are satisfied, then a utility function $u(x)$ exists
- In uncertain settings, decision makers will aim to maximize their expected utility
- Utility is ordinal, not cardinal
- Can be defined in terms of wealth $w$
- Risk averse people have a concave utility function, risk neutral have a linear utility function, and risk loving have a convex utility function
- The **Allais Paradox** and **Ellsberg's Paradox** show that the axiom of independence is often violated
    - Linked to uncertainty and regret
- Research has shown that the way an action is framed can bias irrational agents into becoming rational
    - *Default option bias*: People often choose the default option

# Week 2

## Challenges to EMH

- The **Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox** stipulates that a perfectly efficient market is impossible to achieve
    - Main idea: If markets are already efficient and info is priced in, then traders have no incentive to spend resources to gain more information, so perfect market efficiency is theoretically impossible
    - Model: Traders can be informaed or uninformed, but information about fundamentals incurs a cost
    - Assumptions: EMH, rational expectations, information costs
    - Equilibrium: There is an equilibrium fraction of informed traders based on information cost and trading gains based on info
    - Main result: The fraction of informed traders is greater than 0 but less than 1; must have inefficiency to motivate traders, but prices should reflect most publicly available information
- Shiller (1981) argued that stocks are more volatile than can be explained by the changes in dividends
    - Main idea: The predicted value of a stock should have more volatility (variance) than the actual value of a stock; empirically proved false, suggesting excess volatility
    - Finds that fundamental information is not the only factor in pricing stocks
- DeBondt and Thaler (1985) gave evidence that the stock market will overreact to news; extreme movements are often followed by large adjustments
    - Main idea: Look at winner and loser stocks, see how their returns evolve over time
    - Finds that winner stocks in a three year period will go down in the next three year period and vice versa for loser stocks
    - Goes against EMH; returns are predictable
- EMH states that non-fundamental information should not affect prices, but many papers disagree
    - **January effect**, documented by Klein (1983), shows that stock prices increase in January
    - **Index fund inclusion**, shown in Harris and Gurel (1986) and Shleifer (1986), states that stocks recently added to the S&P 500 increase in price on average

## Cognitive Biases

- Kahneman and Tversky made strides in finding that actors are not rational
- Four main irrationalities
    - *Representativeness*: People make judgements by a general idea of what the data represents as opposed to the data's true implications
        - Linked to *base rate neglect*: individuals ignore the base rate of something happening
    - *Conservatism*: Individuals underweight new info and emphasize prior beliefs
    - *Framing*: The different ways a question/problem is told will elicit different answers
    - *Anchoring*: Individuals will be biased given a reference point
- Thaler (1985) revealed the bias of **mental accounting**: money is treated based on its origin, its purpose, or the decision maker's mental account
    - A *mental account* can be thought of as a set purpose for money; e.g. a vacation fund vs. a checkings account
    - One application is with dividends: people are more likely to spend money from dividends (since it is "found money", like a gift or tax refund) as opposed to capital gains income
- **Isolation Effect**: Decision makers prioritize differentiating features while disregarding commonalities in order to reduce one's cognitive load; known as "editing the prospect"
- **Small Probabilities Effect**: Rare events are weighted higher than their objective probabilities, influencing the choices people make in order to avoid unlikely losses (insurance) or realize unlikely gains (lottery)
    - Implies that subjective probabilities don't increase proportionally
- **Reflection Principle**: Decision makers are typically risk averse in the positive domain (more willing to take a certain win) and risk-loving in the negative domain (more willing to gamble to potentially lose less)
- **Loss Aversion**: People feel a loss more strongly than a gain of equivalent value

## Prospect Theory

- *Standard Utility Theory (SUT)* assumes that the utility function is smooth and concave
- **Prospect Theory** accounts for the above biases by having utility functions that are not necessarily globally concave
    - Involves looking at options, editing, evaluating the edited prospects, and making a choice; different than SUT where one goes immediately from looking at options to making a choice
- The editing stage is used for DMs to simplify and organize prospects, reducing complex choices into simpler ones; has many stages
    - **Coding**: Set a reference point and consider gains/losses relative to this point
    - **Combination**: Similar outcomes are combined to simplify the choice
    - **Segregation**: Risk-free and risky components are seperated
    - **Cancellation**: Shared aspects of options are ignored and differences are emphasized
- Evaluation is based on the edited prospects and relative to the reference point
    - Value (utility) function is defined on gains and losses, where gains are concave and losses are convex

$$
\text{Value function:}\\
v(x) = \begin{cases}
    x^\alpha, & x\geq 0\\
    -\lambda(-x^\beta), & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

- Empirically, $\alpha = \beta = 0.88$ and $\lambda = 2.25$
- Prospect Theory proposes a probability weighting function were small probabilities are overweighted and moderate/large probabilities are underweighted
    - PWF is non-linear, has inverted S shape
- $$\pi(p) = \frac{p^\gamma}{(p^\gamma + (1-p)^\gamma)^{1-\gamma}} \\$$
- $\gamma$ is a parameter that controls the degree of curvature; smaller values have greater curve, while $\gamma=1$ is linear weighting
