- Virtual worlds are defined as places where users can interact with each other that foster community 
    - Concerns for moderation; many users are anonymous
    - Synchronous and persistent; every user interacts with the world in real time, and a change made in the world persists over time
    - When virtual worlds are destroyed, they "sunset" the world
- In virtual worlds, players/users are worldbuilders who create worlds for others
- Virtual worlds were used for a number of things; educational, entertainment, pornography, etc.
    - "Sinful activities" were often more popular
- Virtual worlds have declined since the 2010s with two exceptions: WoW and Minecraft
    - 2021-2022 have seen the revival of virtual worlds with the metaverse, but that, too, failed
- Virtual worlds have been replaced by online multiplayer games (Fortnite, LoL) and social media (Instagram, Twitter)
    - Shows how virtual worlds are bigger than just video games; the idea of entering digital spaces and creating worlds is nearly still extremely prevalent
- Virtual worlds allow people to present different forms of their identity, especially with avatars; allows people to present as different genders (good for transgenders, bad bc of catfishers) or races
- The Sims as Worldbuilding
    - Allows people to build their own worlds and create a fantasized version of reality
    - For character customization, you must choose a binary gender, and the genders you choose force you to choose certain looks (mascara, stubble, etc)
    - Sims places many restrictions on the player and forces them into things
        - Shows that virtual worlds are inherently based on reality, and many societal norms are impossible to escape even in virtual worlds
