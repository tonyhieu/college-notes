## Simple Sports Betting

- *Odds*: X:1 odds on an event happening means that, for every one dollar you would lose if the event happens, you gain X dollars if it doesn't happen
    - In this class, we used **fractional odds**: a-to-b odds, written as a/b
    - For every b dollars bet, you get a dollars in profit
- **Hedging**: Managing investments/bets to eliminate risk; guarantee profit

$$
\text{Assume you have N dollars and that there are two sets of odds: } O_A : 1 \text{ on A and } O_B : 1 \text{ on B.} \\
\text{Finding guaranteed profit:} \\
\pi _A = \pi _B = p^* \\
O_B (n - x^*) - x^* = O_A (x^*) - (n - x^*) \\
x^* = \frac{n(1 + O_B)}{2 + O_A + O_B} \\
p^* = \frac{n(O_A O_B - 1)}{2 + O_A + O_B} \\
\text{Range of x values such that profit is always positive:} \\
\text{Profit if A happens: } -x + O_B (n - x) > 0 \\
x < \frac{O_B n}{1 + O_B} \\

\text{Profit if B happens: } -(n - x) + O_A x > 0 \\
x > \frac{n}{1 + O_A} \\
\frac{n}{1 + O_A} < x < \frac{O_B n}{1 + O_B}

$$

- A **fair bet** is when the expected value of winning is 0
    - The sum of implied probabilities in a fair bet equals 100%
    - Bookmakers set the sum of implied probabilities to over 100% in order to ensure a profit
    - If you are offered a set of bets with a sum of implied probabilities being less than 100%, then you have an arbitrage opportunity

$$
\text{Odds of A happening if } O_A : 1 \text{ odds are given is } \frac{O_A}{1 + O_A}
$$

## Long and Short Option Pricing

### Option Definitions
- **Option**: A contract that allows you to purchase some product at a specified value at the expiration date
- **Strike price**: The cost of purchasing an option at the current moment
- Owning the option allows you to take an action; should always cost something
    - Owning an option is known as *being long*, and the cost of an option is calld a *premium*
- Selling an option means you sell the rights to a counterparty and must allow them to exercise their action
    - Selling an option is known as *being short*
- Options are *derivative securities*, as they derive their values from the prices of other securities like stocks, gold, or oil
- Call Option $C_E (S)$
    - A long call option is the right to buy an asset S at an agreed value E (aka the strike or exercise price) at a future date
- Put Option $P_E (S)$
    - A long put option is the right to sell an asset S at an agreed value E on a future date
- Four types of options: long put, short put, long call, short call
    - Linear combinations of puts and calls can be created for custom payoff structures
- Options are defined by the strike/exercise price E, expiration date, and exercise style
    - *American* style: can be exercised any time before expiration
    - *European* style: can be exercised only at expiration
- Options can be in/at/out of the money depending on S compared to E

### Values at Expiration

- For a long call, its value at expiration is $max(0, S-E)$
    - If the asset price is less than the strike price, then the option is worthless
    - Any difference in strike and asset price is profit, adds value to the option

- For a short call, you only get the profit of the strike price and incur a loss depending on the asset value

- For a long put, you are given the option of selling a stock S at the strike price E; you want the stock S to go down in price in order to make profit

- For a short put, you want the stock price to go up; risk is bounded at -E

- You can put together puts and calls to make portfolios and minimize risk

## Put-Call Parity

- Basic compounding equation
    - $P_{t + n} = (1 + r)^n P_t$
- Compounding equation where interest compounds M times per year
    - $P_{final} = (1 + r/M)^M P_0$
    - $\lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} (1 + r/M)^M = e^r$
        - Derived from the fact that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n = e$
    - Continuous compounding is better for modeling compared to discrete modeling
    - **Final compounding model**: $P_{final} = e^{rt} P_0$, where r is the APR and t is the number of years
    - **Present value of money**: $P_0 = P_{final} e^{-rt}$
- Value of money over time
    - $\Delta M(t) = r M(t) \Delta t \rightarrow \sum \frac{\Delta M}{M} = r \sum \Delta t$
    - As the change in t goes to 0, the equation becomes $\int \frac{1}{M} dM = r \int dt$
    - If $E = M(T = t)$, then $\int_{M(T)}^E \frac{1}{M} dM = r\int_{t}^T dt \rightarrow M(t) = Ee^{-r(T - t)}$
- Put-Call Parity Equation

$$
\text{Consider two portfolios. } \\
\text{Having a stock and the right to sell it: } S + P_E (S,t)\\
\text{Having the right to buy a stock and enough money to purchase it: } C_E(S, t) + Ee^{-r(T-t)} \\
\text{The payoff of these portfolios will have identical values at expiration in the cases } E > S, E \leq S \\
\text{Therefore, } S + P_E (S,t) = C_E(S, t) + Ee^{-r(T-t)} \text{; this is the Put-Call Parity Equation.}
$$


- $\text{If } S + P_E (S,t) > C_E(S, t) + Ee^{-r(T-t)} \text{, then there is an arbitrage opportunity}$
    - Sell the lefthand side and buy the righthand side, depositing $Ee^{-r(T-t)}$ in the bank
    - Arbitrage profit: $S + P_E (S,t) - C_E(S, t) - Ee^{-r(T-t)} > 0$
    - This portfolio ($-S - P_E + C_E + E$) will costlessly liquidate
    - At expiration, if $S \geq E$:
        - The put option is worthless and won't be exercised
        - Use the call option to buy the stock at a lower price E using your bank balance
        - Use the stock you purchased to cover the short sale of S
    - If $S < E$:
        - The call option is worthless and you won't use it
        - Use the bank balance E to buy the stock at the strike price E when the put option you sold is exercised
        - Use the stock you purchased to cover the short sale of S
- $S + P_E (S,t) < C_E(S, t) + Ee^{-r(T-t)} \text{ case}$
    - Buy the lefthand side and sell the righthand side, borrowing $Ee^{-r(T-t)}$ from the bank
    - At expiration, if $S \geq E$:
        - The call option will be exercised and you must sell the stock you own at price E
        - Use the money you got from the sale to payoff the bank loan
        - The put option is worthless and wont't be used

## Cheat Sheet

Finding range of profitable values:

Taylor series formula:

$$
\text{One variable: } \sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{f^{(n)} (a)}{n!} (x-a)^n \\
\text{Two variables: } \sum^\infty_{j=0} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{1}{j!k!} (\frac{\partial ^{j+k} f(a_1, a_2)}{\partial x^j \partial y^k}) (x - a_1)^j(y - a_2)^k
$$

Calculating PDF from known distribution:

$$
\text{Suppose } Y = f(X) \text{ and the PDF/CDF of X is known. The PDF of Y can be derived as follows:} \\
F_y(y) = \int_{g(y)}^{h(y)} f_x(x)dx \\
f_y(y) = \frac{d}{dy}\int_{g(y)}^{h(y)} f_x(x)dx = f_x(h(y))h'(y) - f_x(g(y))g'(y) 
$$

## Black-Scholes

- Aims to price a European option before expiration
    - Two aspects: intrinsic value (what is it worth if it expired right now) and time value (speculative aspect)

### Modeling Stock Prices

- Price includes a predictable component and a random (stochastic) component
- **Random walk model**: $\frac{dS}{S} = \mu dt + \sigma dw \rightarrow dS = \mu Sdt + \sigma Sdw$
    - Predictable component: $\mu dt$, where $\mu$ is the average annual growth rate
    - Random component: $\sigma dw$ where $\sigma$ is a measure of the standard deviation of annual returns and dw is a random number generated from N(0, dt)
- **Ito's Lemma**:
- With Ito's Lemma, we can understand more about dS

$$
(dS)^2 = (\mu Sdt + \sigma Sdw)^2 \\
= \mu^2S^2(dt^2) + 2\mu\sigma S^2(dt)(dw) + \sigma^2 S^2(dw)^2\\
= 2\mu\sigma S^2(dt)(dw) + \sigma^2 S^2(dw)^2
$$

Now plug this in to find dV (change in option price)

$$
dV = \sigma S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dw + (\mu)
$$
