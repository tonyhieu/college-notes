## Schools of Economic Thought

### Classical

- Focuses on long run
- Prices and wages are flexible
- Output equals potential output; K and L fixed
- No unemployment aside from frictional and wage rigidity unemployment
- Classical dichotomy, "money is a veil"
    - Because of the dichotomy, monetary and fiscal policy don't do anything
- Famous Classical Economists: Adam Smith, David Ricardo
- Neo-Classical: Ed Prescott, Bob Lucas

### Keynesian

- Focuses on short run but agrees with Classical Economics in the long run
- Prices and wages are fixed/rigid
- Output is demand-determined
- Unemployment can be large and persistent
- Money helps determine demand
    - As a result, monetary and fiscal policy directly influence output and demand
- Keynesians: John M Keynes, John Hicks, James Tobin
- Neo-Keynesians: Greg Mankiw, David Romer

### Monetarist

- Believes that short-run fluctuations are determined by the Quantity Theory of Money (Classical Economics is right in the long run)
- Prices and wages are partially fixed in the short run
- Fiscal policy is not very effective, but monetary policy is
- Monetarists: Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman

### Austrian

- Classical Economics is right in the long run, but there are cycles of optimism and pessimism
    - Booms lead to over-optimism and over-investment which leads to recessions
    - Recessions lead to pessimism and under-investment which leads to booms
- Cyclical nature of booms and downturns; Each boom "sows the seeds of the next crisis"
- Recessions are necessary to flush out bad investments, so fiscal and monetary policy are harmful in getting rid of bad investments
- Austrians: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek

### Marxist

- Labor Theory of Value: the value of a good is how much labor it takes to produce
    - Flawed theory
- Economy is divided into laborers and capitalist
- Labor is abundant, earns a subsistence wage
- Capitalists have monopsony power in labor market, so they can pay subsistence wages and take the remaining surplus for themselves
    - Real wage is not equal to marginal product of labor due to monopsony
- Marxists: Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels

## Okun's Law

- On average, GDP grows at 3% per year and unemployment would be unchanged
- When unemployment falls, GDP grows more than expected, and vice versa
    - Slope: -2%; for every one percent increase in unemployment rate, GDP growth falls by two percent

## Bonds

- A bond is a loan to a company; has seceral components
    - *Face value*: How much the loan is for
    - *Maturity*: when the loan must be paid back
    - *Coupon payments*: payments expressed as a percentage of the bond that must be paid over the course of the bond
    - Current price is the current price of the bond, not how much you get when it matures
    - Bond yield is the entirety that you get from the coupon rate and the price
    - Bond yield can be less than the coupon rate if the current price is larger than the face value
