# Deconstructing Odysseus

## People
- Description of Cyclops is contradictory
    - "Doesn't care about their neighbor" (127-128) but comes to Polyphemus' aid (448-450)
    - Don't fear the gods (306-313) but also calls to Poseidon (585-586)
    - Described as a monster, but also acts softly with his herd (495-498, 510-513), talks to his sheep
- Cyclops have been described as gentle, loving creatures, as seen in Theocritus' works

## Cyclops
- Pyschic Traits
    - Has a bond with the gods (specifically, Poseidon)
    - Has an understanding of fate, knows that one's fate cannot be changed (seen in prayer to Poseidon)
- Crime
- Xenia in the Cyclops adventure
    - Odysseus breaks Xenia first by inviting himself inside and trespassing (host doesn't invite guest in)
    - Odysseus eats Polyphemus' food without permission (260-262) (host doesn't off a meal)
    - Odysseus offers Polyphemus a gift (wine) and Polyphemus reciprocates (eat him last)
        - Both Odysseus' and Polyphemus' gifts were deceptive

## Odysseus' name(s)
- Outis and Metis - nobody, play on words
- Outidanos - "Dwarf, a spineless good-for-nothing", linked to given name of Outis
    - Demeaning insult, calling him a nobody and a smaller force

## Odysseus and the Cyclops: 2 readings
- Reading 1: Odysseus and the Cyclops as foils, with Odysseus being the better one
    - Cyclops is large but dumb, culturally strange, a loner with no knowledge of politics, sacreligious
    - Odysseus is small but crafty, culturally knowledgable, political genius, religious
- Reading 2: Odysseus and the Cyclops as foils
    - Cyclops is a big sheperd, minds his own business and lives alone, lives near his neighbors, a tender man, and on good terms with his father Poseidon
    - Odysseus is a small human who trespasses an empty house and eats their food; expects hospitality gifts and steals sheep from Polyphemus' cave

- Lotus represent forgetting home, symbolic death for Odysseus and his men because they lose their mission
    - Odysseus becomes a giver of lotus; gives Cyclops wine to trick him
    - Odysseus shows himself as greed because he gives the Cyclops as much wine as he wants, no moderation
