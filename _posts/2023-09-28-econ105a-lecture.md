## Budget Chapter

### Consumption Choice Sets

- Consumers must choose a *consumption bundle*; can be thought of as their "problem" with the "solution" being the optimal bundle
    - **Consumption Choice Set**: A collection of all consumption choices <u>available</u> to the consumer
    - Drawing graphs can be helpful to visualize the optimal way to pick a consumption bundle given a set of constraints
        - Constraints include anything that disallows you from consumption; other constraints include money, storage, time, etc.
        - Basic analysis will use money/income as the main constraint

### Budget Constraints

- A consumption bundle containing x<sub>1</sub> units of commodity 1, x<sub>2</sub> units of commodity, and so on up to x<sub>n</sub> units of commodity n is denoted by (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>)
- Commoditive prices are exogenous (must be taken as given) and are given by p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>
- Q: When is (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>) affordable at p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>?
- A: When p<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... + p<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> <= m, where the left side represents expenditure and the right side, m, represents the consumer's income

-  Affordable budgets that are <u>just</u> affordable form the consumer's **budget constraint (BC)**

$$
\text{Mathematically, the budget constraint can be written as follows:} \\
\{(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) | p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + ... + p_n x_n = m, x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, ..., x_n \geq 0\}
$$

- **Budget Set (B)**: The set of all affordable bundles

$$
\text{Mathematically, the budget set can be written as follows:} \\
B(p_1, ..., p_n, m) = \{(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) | p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + ... + p_n x_n \leq m, x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, ..., x_n \geq 0\}
$$

#### Visualizing Budget Constraints and Budget Sets with Two Goods

- With two goods, a graph for budget constraints and sets can be represented on two axes

$$
\text{For two goods where } x_1 \text{ is on the horizontal axis, the slope of the BC can be written as } -\frac{p_1}{p_2}
$$
