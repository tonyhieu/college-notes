Goal of lecture: identify questions being asked

- First example of worldbuilding: creating fictional "countries" based on real countries, such as Ecotopia and Cascadia (with both countries being on the American West Coast)
    - Spurs thinking about what you need in a world and what could be possible

- **Worldbuilding**: Creating worlds and stories through media; must take into account many factors
    - Can also use worldbuilding to build a better world in real life; rallies, secret meetings, revolution

- **Late Anthroprocene**: The current, modern era in Earth's history (vs. jurassic, triassic, etc.)
    - Some consider it amazing (one species has had so much impact on Earth), others don't (climate change)
    - What kind of worldbuilding is possible in the late anthroprocene?
    - How do we prepare ourselves to build — and rebuild — our world?

- **Rhetoric**: The art of talking and persuading
    - Must take into account your position, your audience, your purpose, the context, etc.
    - Originated in Ancient Rome as a way to gain power in a democratic government
    - Key to effective communication

- **Aesthetic (Education)**: The idea that everyone should be generally educated so they can move between careers/jobs
    - Created in order to have more educated, well-informed students
    - Gen ed classes are based off of aesthetic education
    - Arts and humanities spur self-reflection and thinking, making it a requirement for an aesthetic (general) education
    - May have led to Europe being more advanced compared to the rest of the world, thus European world domination

- What kinds of minds and characters can we cultivate that OUR WORLD cannot afford to be without?
