S<sub>x</sub> is the support of an event, AKA the set of outcomes that can occur
- For example, when flipping a coin, the support can be thought of as 0 and 1, where 0 is heads and 1 is tails
P(X = x) corresponds to a pmf (probability mass function)
P(X â‰¤ x) corresponds to a cdf (continuous discrete function)
E(X) corresponds to the Expectation of X (or expected value)
VAR(X) corresponds to the variance of X, where the standard deviation of a set is equal to the square root of the variance
