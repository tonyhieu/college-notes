## Budget Chapter

### Real World Applications: Food Stamp Program (Continued)

- Building from last time, suppose that you can now trade a food stamp for 50 cents
    - Assume that food stamps can only be sold, not purchased, by households
    - The budget constraint increases at the top while the majority of the budget constraint remains the same
        - This is because a household would never sell food stamps most of the time; you lose 50 cents of value, and if you cut back on spending, you would cut back on dollar spending, not food stamp spending

### Relative Prices

- **Numeraire**: Unit of account
    - Changing the numeraire does not change neither the budget constraint nor the budget set, as all relative prices remain the same
    - Interestingly, we can use the price of a good as a numeraire
        - For example, good 1 would be worth 1 unit of good 1, and good 2 + consumer income would be evaluated similarly

### Shape of Budget Constraints

- A linear budget constraint means that the exchange rate (or opportunity cost) remains constant, but oftentimes, that is not the case
    - Consider the food stamps example; the graph of the budget constraint had changing slopes because the exchange rate varied
    - In general, if prices are **constant**, the budget constraint will be a straight line (AKA a budget line)
- **Quantitative discounts** and **quantity penalties** will often affect the price of a good depending on how much ones buys
    - "Buying in bulk" is an example of a quantitative discount, while government restrictions on buying too much of a good would be an example of a quantity penalty
    - Assuming that one good's price (on y axis) is constant and the other's price (on x axis) fluctuates:
        - A quantitative penalty would cause the graph to be *concave dow*; i.e. the more you buy, the worse the relative price gets (represented in black)
        - A quantitative discount would cause the graph to be *concave up*; i.e. the more you buy, the better the relative price gets (represented in red)

## Preferences Chapter

- Budget is one aspect of a consumer's choice; preferences allow the consumer to choose a consumption bundle from the bundle set
- This chapter assumes that all consumers act rationally
    - Decisionmakers always choose their most <u>preferred</u> alternative from their set of available alternatives
    - This isn't inherently realistic; *bound regressionality* states that decisionmakers can only spend so much time + energy making choices, meaning that they're not always going to make the right decision

### Preference Relation

- Comparing two different consumption bundles, x and y:
$$
\text{Weak Preference: x is weakly preferred to y: } x \succeq y \\
\text{Strict Preference: x is strictly preferred to y: } x \succ y \text{. i.e. } x \succeq y, x \npreceq y \\
\text{Indifference: x and y are equally preferred: } x \sim y \text{. i.e. } x \succeq y, x \preceq y \\ \\
$$

- These relations are only <u>ordinal</u>; that is, they state only the order in which bundles are preferred, but not by how much more
- Note that weak preference implies that x could EITHER be strictly preferred or equally preferred to y
