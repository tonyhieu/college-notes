## Distinction Between Classical and Keynesian Economics
- Classical economics focuses on the long run, doesn't acknowledge "bumps" that the economy might go through
- Keynesian economics focuses on these "bumps" and aruges that they are persistent and important to the economy

## Fundamentals of Keynesian Economics
- Keynes argues that there is a general economic theory, and classical economics represents one aspect of his theory
- Output and employment depends not only on fixed labor supply and capital, but also demand for goods and services
    - Demand is affected by fiscal/monetary policy, demand from foreigners, and other exogenous changes (I, C, etc.)
    - Output is therefore demand-determined

## Keynesian Cross

- The cross expresses the (classic) goods market equilibrium in terms of planned expenditure
    - C = *planned* consumption
    - I = *planned* investment
    - G = *planned* gov't purchases
    - PE = C + I + G = *planned* expenditure
    - Y = real GDP = production
    - Difference between PE and Y is unplanned inventory investment
- Other elements of the Cross
    - Consumption function: C(Y - T) = MPC * (Y - T) (where MPC is marginal propensity to consume)
    - Government purchases, taxes: G and T
    - Investment: I(r), but can be also written as I
    - Planned expenditure: PE = C + I + G = MPC * (Y - T) + I + G
    - Equilibrium condition: PE = Y, or Y = MPC * (Y - T) + I + G, where T, I, and G are constants

## Keynesian Multiplier

$$
Y = C + I + G \\
\Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta I + \Delta G \\
I = \bar{I}, \Delta I = 0 \\
C = MPC \cdot (Y - \bar{T}), \Delta C = MPC \cdot \Delta Y \\
\Delta Y =  MPC \cdot \Delta Y + \Delta G \\
\Delta Y = \frac{1}{1 - MPC} \Delta G \\
\text{Since MPC >= 1,} \Delta Y \geq \Delta G
$$

The **government purchases multiplier** is the increase in output that results from a $1 increase in G (or delta Y / delta G)
