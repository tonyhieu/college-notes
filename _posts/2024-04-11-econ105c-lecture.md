# Open Economy Macroeconomics

- Closed economies assume that there is no exports nor imports, but many economies across the world require trade to function
- These are **open economies**, and they are important because many countries and industries rely on international trade

## National Income Accounting

- In a closed economy, the equations *Y = C + I + G* and *S = I* are true because there is no outside trade
    - G and T represent government spending and taxes
    - Household disposable income is Y - T
    - Household consumption and saving is Y - T - C = S<sup>H</sup>, where C is a function of Y - T s.t. C = C(Y - T)
    - Government saving is T - G = S<sup>G</sup>
    - National savings are S = S<sup>H</sup> + S<sup>G</sup>
- In an open economy, these terms change
    - C = C<sup>d</sup> + C<sup>f</sup> (where d = domestic and f = foreign)
    - I = I<sup>d</sup> + I<sup>f</sup>
    - G = G<sup>d</sup> + G<sup>f</sup>
    - X = exports of domestically produced goods and services to other nations
    - IM = imports of internationally produced goods and serivces to a home nation
    - NX = exports - imports
- These terms imply that domestic spending might not equal domestic output, nor will domestic saving equal domestic investment
    - Foreign spending and saving can make up the difference
    - Other terms might not be equal due to foreign-held capital and labor, but these differences are fairly insignificant
- In an open economy:
    - C<sup>d</sup> + I<sup>d</sup> + G<sup>d</sup> + X - (C + I + G)
    - = (C<sup>d</sup> - C) + (I<sup>d</sup> - I) + (G<sup>d</sup> - G) + X
    - = -C<sup>f</sup> - I<sup>f</sup> - G<sup>f</sup> + X
    - -> X - IM = 0 = NX

## Current and Capital Accounts

- The **current account** is a country's net exports of goods and services plus net foreign aid to the country
- If NX > 0, then there is a trade surplus; if NX < 0, then there is a trade deficit
- **Net (financial) capital outflows**: S - I = the net outflow of "lonable funds" = net purchases of foreign assets
    - AKA domestic country's purchases of foreign assets minus foreign purchases of domestic assets
- S > I, country is a net lender; S < I, country is a net borrower
- **Capital account** is the inverse of net capital outflows

$$
NX = Y - (C + I + G) \\
= (Y - C - G) - I \\
= (Y - T - C - G + T) - I = S - I \\
\text{trade balance} = \text{net capital outflows} \\
\text{current account} = -\text{capital account} \\
\text{current account} + \text{capital account} = 0\\
NX + I - S = 0
$$

## Is a Current Account (AKA Trade) Deficit Bad?

- In some cases, yes; in others, no
- If a country has a trade deficit because they have bad domestic products, then the deficit is bad
- If a country has a trade deficit because everyone wants to import into the US, then the deficit is good

## Open Economy Model

- Three assumptions
    - Domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes
    - Perfect capital mobilityL no restrictions on international trade in assets
    - Economy is small: cannot affect the world interest rate
- Similar to the loanable funds model
    - Production function: Y = F(K, L)
    - Consumption function: C = C(Y - T)
    - Investment function: I = I(r)
    - Exogenous policy variables: G bar, T bar, etc.

## Exchange Rates

- **Nominal exchange rate** (e): The relative price of domestic currency in units of foreign currency
- **Real exchange rate** (ε): The relative prive of domestic goods in units of foreign goods
    - Normally equal to 1 (e.g. one JP car is same as one US car)
    - Can be thought of as the relative price of a basket of goods vs. a basket of foreign goods

$$
\epsilon = e \frac{P^d}{P^f}
$$

- Exports and imports depend on the exchange rate
    - When ε goes up, US goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods, meaning that exports goes down and imports go up, so net exports goes down
        - X and NX down, IM up
    - When ε goes down, the opposite happens; foreign goods are expensive, so exports goes up and imports go down, so net exports goes up

## Real Exchange Rate Equilibrium

- NX = S - I
    - S is determined on domestic factors, as it represents savings
    - I is determined by the world interest rate r*
    - ε adjusts the net export demand to be equal to the capital account balance

## World Economy
- The world economy is a closed economy
    - Can use closed economy models for the world 


## Large Open Economies

- The US and China are considered the two large open economies
    - This means they lie in between a closed economy and a small open economy
    - Analysis of a large open economy will lie between a closed and small open economy; similar to taking the average
