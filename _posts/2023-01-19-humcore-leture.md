title: Continuing Quilts + Titus Kaphar
---

- Worldbuilding with African-American art
    - The existence of the Quilts of Gee's Bend imply that these African-American women were unable to find work in the most prosperous country in the world
        - Shows racism, discrimination, inability to have upwards mobility
        - Continued disparity between African-Americans and other races; calls back to slavery
- Critics of the Quilts of Gee's Bend often referenced white, wealthy modern painters when discussing the quilts, dismissing the creativity and different circumstances surrounding the quilts
