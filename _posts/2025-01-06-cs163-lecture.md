## Graph Representation

Want the following out of a graph data structure:
    - Count vertices: O(1)
    - Iterate through all vertices: O(1) per vertex
    - Associate information with vertices: O(1) per get/set
    - Iterate through all edges: O(1) per edge
    - Get degree of vertex: O(1)
    - Count all edges: O(1)
    - Iterate through edges in/out of a vertex: O(1) per edge
    - Associate information with edges: O(1) per get/set
    - Test whether two vertices are connected by an edge: O(1)

### Decorator Pattern and Adjacency Lists

Possible solutions:


1. Dictionary, with vertices as keys
2. Number vertices and index an array using those numbers
3. Separate variables for vertex objects for each piece of information
4. One dictionary varialbe per vertex with keys for each piece of information

- An **adjacency list** uses a dictionary of vertices as keys and the list of outgoing neighbors as values
    - There are lots of different variations on this structure; different objects for vertices and edges
- The Python-style dictionary representation satisfies the time constraints needed for an efficient PageRank algorithm
    - Some operations are not supported; e.g. looping through incoming edges can be slow

## BFS/DFS

- **Implicit graph**: A graph whose edges and vertices are not already given and must be found through an algorithm (like BFS)
- A **path** is an alternating sequence of endpoints and edges that does not allow repetition
- A **walk** is the same as a path but allows repetition
- **Reachability**: Does there exist a path between two nodes? If so, then they are reachable from each other


## Minimum Spanning Trees
- Given an undirected graph, find a tree that connects all vertices and minimizes the total weight
- Disconnected graphs will output a **spanning forest** as opposed to a tree
- Minimize and maximize are the same problem; simply make weights negative

### Applications

- Build an optimal power grid/transportation routes with minimal total construction cost
- Build a computer network with maximum badwidth - maximum spanning tree
- The minimum spanning tree has the smallest possible bottle neck out of all trees; maximum has the largest

### Properties

- Assumes that there are no "tied" edges, and if they do have the same edge, then use a consistent tiebreaking method
- **Cycle property**: If C is a cycle in the original graph G, then the heaviest edge in this cycle cannot be in the MST
    - In other words: If C is any cycle and e is its heaviest edge, then an MST that contains e will not be the MST
- **Cut property**: If we cut the vertices of the graph into any two subsets of vertices X and G - X, and e is the lihtest edge with endpoints in both subsets, then e must be in the MST
    - Can be used to derive algorithms
- **Path property**: For any two vertices x and y, the MST path from x to y has the minimum possible weight for its heaviest edge

### Algorithms

- Most algorithms to find an MST takes O(n log n) time and utilize the cut property
- Algorithms have been found that take close to linear time or expected linear time but randomized 

#### Jarnik's Algorithm (Prim-Dijkstra)

- Start with some vertex S; this will be the start of the MST, named T
- Repeat until T contains all vertices:
    1. Partition the graph into T and G - T
    2. Find the minimum-weight edge e connecting T and G - T
    3. Add e to T (as well as its corresponding vertex)
- Can be implemented via a priority queue
    - Store vertices not yet in T by the weight of the minimum-weight edge that would connect it to T
    - Update the priority queue each time you update T by looping through the edges
- Using a binary heap, all find/remove operations take O(log n) time, so the total time is **O(m log n)** because each edge is looped over twice
- A Fibonacci heap can get this down to O(m + n log n)

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

- Start by creating a forest of one-vertex trees
- Sort the edges by weight
- For each edge, if it connects two different trees, conenct the trees and add the edge to the MST
- O(m log m) for sorting, O(m) to iterate through list; **O(m log m)** total
- Can use the union-find data structure for near-constant lookups of forests

#### Boruvka's Algorithm (Sollin)

- Start by creating a forest of one-vertex trees
- Label vertices by their tree
- While there is more than one tree, find the minimum-weight outgoing edge from each forest
    - Add all of these minimum-weight edges to the T and connect the forests using them
- The number of trees will go down by a factor of 2 or more, so we will do this iteration log n times
- Looping through all m edges per iteration means the runtime is **O(m log n)**

#### Hybrid Algorithm
- Run Boruvka's algorithm until the number of trees is less than or equal to n / log n
- Run Jarnik's algorithm with Fiboniacci heaps, using a priority queue on the trees as opposed to the vertices
- O(m log log n) from Boruvka and O(m) from Jarnik means that the total runtime is O(m log log n) 

## Topological Ordering

- **Topological ordering**: A list of all vertices in G such that, for every edge $x \rightarrow y$, x is before y in the list
- **Topological sorting**: An algorithm to compute a topological ordering
- Graphs that have cycles cannot have a topological ordering
    - Thus, only directed acyclic graphs can have a topological ordering
- Can use a simple greedy algorithm; add vertices with no incoming edges to the ordering, and remove its outgoing edges from the graph
    - If there is ever a point where there are no "ready" vertices but there are still vertices left to process, then there is a cycle
    - To find the cycle: go to a remaining vertex and walk forward until a vertex is repeated; the sequence between the repititions is the cycle

## Shortest and Longest Paths

- Shortest path can found by BFS; longest path is NP-hard because it includes finding a Hamiltonian path
    - When there exists negative paths, then shortest path is NP-hard
- Shortest walk is not possible if the graph has a negative cycle; can keep walking around the cycle and reducing total weight
- For finding shortest paths in directed graphs:
    - If graph is DAG, use topological ordering (O(m))
    - If graph has nonnegative edge lengths, use Dijkstra's (close to linear time)
        - Works on undirected graphs
    - If graph has negative edges but no negative cycle, use Bellman-Ford algorithm (O(mn))
        - Can also detect negative cycles if one exists
    - Bellman-Ford is optimal and can be improved based on recent results
    - Dijkstra's is "universally optimal" for a fixed graph with variable, positive weights

### Critical Path Scheduling (PERT method)
- Input: a project consisting of multiple tasks that take different amounts of time
- Some tasks can be done simultaneously; others rely on earlier tasks to be completed
- Goal: Find a schedule for the tasks that finishes the project in the lowest possible time
    - AKA longest path finder
- Can use an **activity-on-edge** graph; tasks are converted to edges, and vertices are project milestones
    - Constraints are represented by directed edges and have zero weight
    - The **critical path** is the longest path in this graph from start to end and is the minimum possible time for the schedule
    - Assign times to vertices by making sure that the difference between stages is greater than or equal to the length of the edge between them
- To calculate the optimal schedule, we can use a topological ordering
    - Set the path length of the starting vertex to 0
    - Find the largest incoming edge $u\rightarrow v$ and set the path length of v to $L(u) + weight(u \rightarrow v)$
- Can find the smallest incoming edge to get the shortest paths 

### Shortest Path Trees and Relaxation Algorithms

- In graphs without negative cycles, we can generate a tree of shortest paths
- If s is the startest vertex, then other vertices will have parents are the vertices that come before them their shortest path
    - e.g. if the shortest path from x to c is $x \rightarrow b \rightarrow c$, then b is a parent of c in the tree
- Input: A graph with edge lengths and a starting vertex
- Output: Tree of shortest paths from s to all other reachable vertices
    - Two decorations per vertex: the parent and distance from start vertex
- General idea: use the two decorations and update them when shorter paths are found
- Invariants
    - D is the length of some path to x that is greater than or equal to the correct value
    - P is the second-to-last vertex on a path of length â‰¤D
- Initialize by setting P(x) = None and D(x) = 0 if the vertex is s; otherwise D(x) = infinity
- For each edge uv, check whether the distance to u + the length of uv is less than the current shortest path for v, then update if so
- If the graph is a DAG:
    - Simple algorithm is to go through vertices in topological order and relaxing each vertices edges
    - Total time is O(m)

```
initialize D, P
for v in topological order:
    for incoming edges uv:
        relax(u, v)
```

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Uses relaxation paradigm and takes O(mn) times

```
initialize D, P
repeat n-1 times:
    for each edge uv in the whole graph:
        relax(u, v)
```

- Can be improved based on ordering of nodes or stopping early; still results in same big O

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Topologically sorts the shortest path tree by sorting vertices by distance
    - Uses a priority queue to order on the fly

```
initialize D, P
make priority queue Q of vertices, prioritized by D[v]
while Q is non-empty:
    find and remove minimum-priority vertex v in Q
    for each edge vw:
        relax(vw)
```

- Takes O(m log n) with a binary heap or O(m + n log n) with a Fibonacci heap
