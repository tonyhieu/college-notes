Assume you take a simple random sample (SRS) of n invidivduals from a (approximately) normally distributed population
- Sample mean = x̄ = µ = population mean
- Sample standard deviation = s = σ/sqrt(n) where σ = population standard deviation
- Notated as X ~ ApproximatelyNormal(µ, σ/sqrt(n))
- If the population is not (approximately) normally distributed, you must take an SRS of n ≥ 30 individuals to get an AN sample distribution
