<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Money</strong>: The assets in an economy that people use to regularly purchase goods and services from each other
    <ul>
      <li>Cash, credit cards, etc. are considered money while houses, investments are not</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Functions of Money</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Three functions: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value</li>
  <li>A <strong>medium of exchange</strong> is an item that buyers give to sellers in exchange for their goods and services</li>
  <li>A <strong>unit of account</strong> is a method to compare the value of two goods in an economy
    <ul>
      <li>In prisons and extremely poor nations, cigarettes are often used as a unit of account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>store of value</strong> is an item that people use to transfer purchasing wealth from the present to the future
    <ul>
      <li>A seller receives money now so they can buy something else in the future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Liquidity</strong> is the ease of which an asset can be turned into a medium of exchange
    <ul>
      <li>Money is the most liquid while houses, paintings, etc. are not as liquid</li>
      <li>Must balance liquidity with store of value; money is very liquid but can lose value easily with inflation, while paintings can increase in value over time but are not very liquid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Kinds of Money</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Commodity money</strong> is money that takes the form of a commodity that has intrinsic value
    <ul>
      <li>Gold has historically been used as money because it has many uses, thus giving it a high intrinsic value</li>
      <li>Economies using gold (or that can easily turn their currency into gold) are said to be under a <em>gold standard</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Fiat money</strong> is money without intrinsic value, such as paper bills
    <ul>
      <li>Fiat money is established as money by governments, but the value of fiat money is highly dependent on the confidence of the public in the government issuing the fiat money</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Money in the U.S. Economy</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<em>Money stock</em> represents the amount of money circulating in an economy, but there are many different ways to measure it
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Currency</strong> is always included in the measurement of the money stock, but other things like <strong>demand deposits</strong> (money that can be easily accessed from a bank account) should also be included</li>
      <li>Things like savings accounts, purchasing power on margin, etc. could all be considered part of the money stock; makes it difficult to measure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the rest of this book, the money stock will include currency and deposits in banks and other institutions that can be easily accessed to buy goods and services</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#29-2-the-federal-reserve-system" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>29-2: The Federal Reserve System</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The agency responsible for regulating fiat money is the <strong>Federal Reserve (Fed)</strong> which is an example of a <strong>central bank</strong> in the United States</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Fed’s Organization</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Headed by a Board of Governors and one chair with 14-year terms and who are appointed by the president
    <ul>
      <li>Federal Reserve System consists of the Federal Reserve Board and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks around the country</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Fed has two jobs
    <ul>
      <li>Regulate banks and make sure the banking system is healthy, which is done by monitoring banks’ actions, loaning money to banks, and acting as a <em>lender of last resort</em> to failing banks</li>
      <li>Control the quantity of <strong>money supply</strong>, or money available in the economy, through <strong>monetary policy</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The FOMC consists of all of members of the Board of Governors and all presidents of the regional banks
    <ul>
      <li>Only 5 of the regional presidents get to vote with the votes rotating, but the New York branch president always gets to vote because NYC is considered the financial center of the United States</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The FOMC decides to increase or decrease the number of dollars in the economy through <em>open-market operation</em>, or the sale and purchase of US government bonds
    <ul>
      <li>If they want to increase money, they purchase bonds (money out, bonds in); if they want to decrease money, they sell bonds (money in, bonds out)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
