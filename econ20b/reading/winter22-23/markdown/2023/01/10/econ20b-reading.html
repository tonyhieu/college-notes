<ul>
  <li>Can judge how a nation (or person) is doing based on the income of the people in that economy</li>
  <li>Gross domestic product (GDP) allows economists to measure income; tracks the total income and total expenditure of an economy
    <ul>
      <li>Note that <em>for an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure</em>
</li>
      <li>If someone pays $100 for a service, then one party gains $100 and one party spends $100; GDP raises by $100 as a whole</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The circular flow diagram is a good representation of GDP
    <ul>
      <li>All of the green arrows in the figure below represent money and, therefore, changes in GDP</li>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong>: the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time
    <ul>
      <li>Definition has many aspects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“GDP is the market value…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP measures market prices to reflect the value of goods sold and purchased</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…of all…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP attempts to measure the market value of every single good sold or purchased in an economy
    <ul>
      <li>Housing is measured by the rental price of the home or, if the house is not being rented, the estimated rental price of the home</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The GDP does not measure illegal products, such as drugs, or products manufactured and consumed in homes, such as a backyard tomato garden
    <ul>
      <li>This can lead to situations where a marriage can lower a GDP if a consumer and producer get married</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…final…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Goods can either be intermediate or final
    <ul>
      <li>
<em>Intermediate goods</em> are used in the process of making a final good; think the corn used in making a tortilla</li>
      <li>
<em>Final goods</em> are the end product of a production process; the tortilla</li>
      <li>GDP only measures the value of final, not intermediate goods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The GDP does measure intermediate goods if it is added to an inventory for use at a later time
    <ul>
      <li>Essentially, additions to an inventory add to the GDP, and when those additions are used at a later time, they are subtracted from the GDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…goods and services…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Both goods (food, books, video games, etc) and services (haircuts, car wash, concerts, etc.) are included in a GDP</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…produced…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GDP only includes goods and services <em>currently</em> produced, not ones produced in the past
    <ul>
      <li>If a car manufacturer creates a car, the value of that car is added to the GDP</li>
      <li>If someone sells an old car to someone else, the valur of that car is not added to the GDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…within a country…“</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP measures the production inside of the geographical boundaries of a country, regardless of the citizenship or nationality of the producer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“…in a given period of time.”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP measures the value of production in an interval of time, which is typically either a financial quarter or year
    <ul>
      <li>Reporting for a GDP for a quarter is typically multiplied by 4 to represent an “annual rate”</li>
      <li>Quarterly GDP data is typically adjusted in order to account for seasonal changes, such as shopping sprees in December</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With these clarifications, the definition of GDP has multiple layers
    <ul>
      <li>Theoretically, the GDP should be equal to the gross domestic income (GDI), but the difference in GDP and GDI can be chalked up to a <em>statistical discrepancy</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#23-3-the-components-of-gdp" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>23-3: The Components of GDP</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP can be understood as a sum of four different types of spending</li>
  <li>Y = C + I + G + NX
    <ul>
      <li>Y represents GDP</li>
      <li>C represents consumption</li>
      <li>I represents investment</li>
      <li>G represents government purchases</li>
      <li>NX represents net exports</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consumption</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Consumption</strong> is spending by households (aka citizens/regular people) on goods and services
    <ul>
      <li>Does not include housing purchases, as those count as an investment</li>
      <li>Services include haircuts and medical care, and goods include food, clothing, appliances, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Investment</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Investment</strong> includes the purchase of goods (known as <em>capital goods</em>) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services</li>
  <li>Includes business capital, residential capital, and inventories/stock
    <ul>
      <li>Business capital: business structures (like factories), equipment, and intellectual property products (software or recipes)</li>
      <li>Residential capital: buildings for rent, personal residences</li>
      <li>Inventory: components, ingredients, intermediate goods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Investment, in this case, does not refer to financial investments such as stocks and bonds; it refers to goods that will be used in the future to create more goods and services</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Government Purchases</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Government purchases</strong> includes spending on goods and services by all types of governments
    <ul>
      <li>Includes salaries of government workers and expenditure on public works</li>
      <li>Known officially as <em>government consumption expenditure and gross investment</em> but known traditionally as <em>government purchases</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Social Security benefits or unemployment is not considered part of government purchases; they are instead defined as <em>transfer payments</em>
    <ul>
      <li>These are not specified as expenditures because no value is being extracted from the production of goods or services; thus, they are not part of the GDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Net Exports</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Net exports</strong> = exports - imports</li>
  <li>Net refers to the subtraction of imports from exports in order to show the amount exported
    <ul>
      <li>Selling a domestic product to a foreign buyer increases GDP, while purchasing a foreign product domestically decreases it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="23-4-real-versus-nominal-gdp">
<a class="anchor" href="#23-4-real-versus-nominal-gdp" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>23-4: Real versus Nominal GDP</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If total spending rises from year to year, either a) more goods and services were produced or b) the price of goods increased
    <ul>
      <li>To measure quantity of goods instead of a change in price, economists use <em>real GDP</em> which uses a market price baseline of a set year</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Numerical Example</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Example table of an economy which produces hot dogs and hamburgers: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/212288137-0f759446-6639-45b1-816d-4bbe325e0be3.png" alt="image">
</li>
  <li>The total expenditure can be simply found by multiplying the current market price by the current quantity of goods sold
    <ul>
      <li>The production of goods and services valued at current prices is called the <strong>nominal GDP</strong>
</li>
      <li>In the table, the nominal GDP for hot dogs and hamburgers continually increases, but this increase can be attributed ot both the increase in price and the increase in production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Real GDP</strong> removes the issue of price changes by valuing goods and services at a set price based on a previous year
    <ul>
      <li>Using 2019 as the base year, we can calculate the value of goods and services using the 2019 market price in order to account for any changes in price</li>
      <li>For the base year, the real GDP will always equal the nominal GDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value the economy’s production of goods and services.</em></li>
  <li>Real GDP is a better measurement of economic well-being because it consistently tracks the level of production between years; real GDP is used to determine economy growth</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The GDP Deflator</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GDP Deflator is calculated as follows:

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This equation allows us to see how the prices of goods and services have changed compared to the base year
    <ul>
      <li>If the prices remain the same from the base to current year, then the GDP deflator remains constant</li>
      <li>If the prices increase or decrease from the base year, then the GDP deflator will also increase or decrease accordingly</li>

<ul>
  <li>GDP tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy, and in most cases, this tells us about the economic well-being of the average person (more expenditure = more money = happier)</li>
  <li>Some disagree that GDP is a good measure of economic well-being, as it does not measure any intangibles such as happiness, bravery, creativity, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>GDP, though not directly connected, can indirectly measure these traits</li>
      <li>More GDP = more education, better nutrition, more specialization for a country</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being
    <ul>
      <li>Production can unnaturally increase (everyone begins working every day of the week), thus increasing GDP but decreasing well-being</li>
      <li>Does not include goods and services produced at home, such as a chef’s home-cooked meals, volunteer work, or the work of stay-at-home parents</li>
      <li>Does not measure environmental factors, such as pollution</li>
      <li>Does not measure distribution of income; a nation with 100 people making $50k has the same GDP as a nation with 1 person making $5 million and 99 people making $0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In general, GDP is a good measure of well-being for most, but not all, purposes</li>
</ul>
