<ul>
  <li>Different countries have different levels of productivity and different GDPs</li>
  <li>This chapter focuses on ways that these statistics can vary from country to country</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Consider the following table: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/214708388-c73a10cf-2347-428e-955e-c0b24dae625f.png" alt="image">
</li>
  <li>Clearly, there are differences in GDP between various countries, but a few things stand out

      <li>
<em>Countries don’t always stay on top</em>: The UK was the richest country in the world but is now behind US, Canada, and Germany</li>
      <li>
<em>Countries don’t always stay poor</em>: Japan, China, and Brazil have experienced incredible growth, taking them for poorer nations to middle-income/rich ones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This table shows that things can vary greatly, but what drives these changes?</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#25-2-productivity-its-role-and-determinants" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>25-2: Productivity: Its Role and Determinants</h3>

<p><strong>Why Productivity Is So Important</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider an isolated economy that must sustain itself through its production and no foreign trade</li>
  <li>The higher said economy’s <strong>productivity</strong> is, the higher its quality of life
    <ul>
      <li>More goods produced means more abundance which means free time, specialization, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Note that an economy’s GDP measures both total income and total expenditure, so GDP is often a good measure of quality of life for economies
    <ul>
      <li>Higher GDP means more production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Productivity Is Determined</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Different factors can affect an economy’s ability to produce</li>
  <li>
<em>Physical Capital</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Workers are more productive if given tools to work with</li>
      <li>The stock of equipment and structures used to produce goods and services is called <strong>physical capital</strong>, or often just capital</li>
      <li>Consider a bakery; the baker requires a rolling pin, baking sheets, an oven, etc. to efficiently produce baked goods
        <ul>
          <li>These factors of production are included in physical capital</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Physical capital can also be used to create more physical capital; a miner mines ore to create nails to build a house</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Human Capital</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Human capital</strong> refers to the knowledge and skills worker gain through education, training, and experience</li>
      <li>A better quality of human capital means a higher productivity</li>
      <li>Producing human capital requires labor and time, such as teachers, libraries, study, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Natural Resources</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Natural resources</strong> refers to inputs into production that are found in nature, such as water, wood, land, etc.
        <ul>
          <li>
<em>Renewable</em> resources include forests, animal husbandry, etc.</li>
          <li>
<em>Nonrenewable</em> resources include oil and minerals</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Differences in natural resources are a big factor for some of the differences in productivity
        <ul>
          <li>US has great farmland, Middle East has a lot of oil, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Some countries without many natural resources, like Japan, can thrive through international trade</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Technological Knowledge</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Technological knowledge</strong> refers to the understanding of the most efficient ways to produce goods and services</li>
      <li>Two types
        <ul>
          <li>Common knowledge, such as the invention of Henry Ford’s assembly line; can be employed by everyone</li>
          <li>Proprietary, such as Coca-Cola’s secret recipe; often patented and only used by the company who discovered it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>“Technological knowledge is the quality of society’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the population has spent reading them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="25-3-economic-growth-and-public-policy">
<a class="anchor" href="#25-3-economic-growth-and-public-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>25-3: Economic Growth and Public Policy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The following section details different policies governments can adopt to improve productivity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Saving and Investment</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical capital is a produced factor of production, so devoting more resources towards it can help improve future production
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a country that uses all of its labor to make food; its production remains stagnant because it doesn’t improve</li>
      <li>If said country used half of its labor to make tools, then in the following year, it would be able to produce more food using the new tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In general, saving and investment can enocourage growth and improve an economy’s standard of living in the long run</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a government passes a new saving rate, how long will they enjoy an increased rate of growth?</li>
  <li>Economists believe that (the saving of) physical capital is subject to <strong>diminishing returns</strong>, so the more you have, the less benefit you get from saving more
    <ul>
      <li>This property is also known as the <em>diminishing marginal product of capital</em>
</li>
      <li>Graph: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54915685/214711939-5ce68189-8278-4bbe-b688-8beb127340c6.png" alt="image">
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>In the long run, a higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income but no to higher growth in those areas</em>
    <ul>
      <li>According to economic studies, the increased growth from a higher saving rate can last for decades</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The presence of diminishing returns leads to the <strong>catch-up effect</strong> where smaller countries can grow at a faster rate than more established ones
    <ul>
      <li>For example, the US and South Korea both had the same saving rate in 1960, but South Korea grew by a lot more due to its smaller size</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Though the catch-up effect leads to more rapid growth, bigger countries will remain bigger because they had more capital to start with</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Investment from Abroad</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Two types of foreign investment
    <ul>
      <li>
<em>Foreign direct investment</em> occurs when a capital investment is owned and operated by a foreign entity
        <ul>
          <li>ex: Ford Motor Company creates a new factory in Mexico</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<em>Foreign portfolio investment</em> occurs when a capital investment is owned by a foreign entity but operated by domestic residents
        <ul>
          <li>ex: said factory is run by Mexicans</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Both types increase the stock of capital in Mexico</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Foreign investments happen because investors expect a return on their money, so the profit made from a domestic factory might be split between foreign investors and residents
    <ul>
      <li>Still, these investments increase the GDP of the country the factory is in</li>
      <li>The GDP measures production and income while the GNP measures only income, so the GDP will increase by more than the GNP due to the cut investors take</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Investment from abroad is beneficial because it increases productivity and allows poorer countries to understand better technologies</li>
  <li>The World Bank encourages investment from abroad into underdeveloped countries to promote stability</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Schooling can increase one’s wages and standard of living considerably, so government policy encouraging schooling can increase the standard of living</li>
  <li>Education incurs an opportunity cost; students could have used the time spent in school working in the work force</li>
  <li>Some economists argue that human capital is especially important because it confers positive externalities such as the production of new technologies</li>
  <li>Poorer countries face the issue of <em>brain drain</em>, or the common practice of educated workers emigrating to richer ones for better wages and a higher standard of living
    <ul>
      <li>Said workers might not come back to their countries of origin to improve its GDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Health and Nutrition</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Human capital can also refer to public health</li>
  <li>Healthier workers are more productive compared to undernourished ones
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, height has been correlated with higher productivity, and nutrition is a direct cause of height</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The link between health and wealth creates a vicious cycle; poorer nations have lower productivity and thus less healthy workers which leads to lower productivity
    <ul>
      <li>The opposite also occurs; wealthier nations have higher productivity and thus healthier workers which leads to higher productivity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Property Rights and Political Stability</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Production relies on the interactions between millions of individuals and firms, and the economy must coordinate said interactions through market prices</li>
  <li>For pricing to work, economies must have a system of property righs which encourage trade and leads to set prices
    <ul>
      <li>If property rights don’t exist, then everyone would steal, thus the justice system enforces laws and contracts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Underdeveloped countries often lack the ability to enforce property rights, leading to fraud, corruption, and crime
    <ul>
      <li>Political instability threatens the existence of property rights, as it is unclear whether or not said rights can be enforced</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Politically stable countries with good governments thus have higher productivity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Free Trade</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Some countries try to use <em>inward-oriented policies</em> which attempt to increase productivity through a lack of interaction with foreign countries
    <ul>
      <li>Supporters of said policies advance the infant-industry argument and are often distrusting of foreigners</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Most economists believe that poorer countries are better off using <em>outward-oriented policies</em> which can act as a sort of technology
    <ul>
      <li>If a country has an abundance of wheat and can trade that wheat for computers, they effectively have technology which turns wheat into computers</li>
      <li>Countries that encourage free trade thus experience a high rate of growth equivalent to a technological advance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Countries with inward-oriented policies must produce everything (food, textiles, technology, etc) by itself, leading to inefficiency</li>
  <li>Countries with seaports and easy access to trade often prosper more than countries without them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Research and Development</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Advances in technological knowledge is a big reason why the quality of life today is better than ever</li>
  <li>Technological advances often come from private firms, but said advances are, to a large extent, a <em>public good</em> that can be used by many people</li>
  <li>Because of this, the US government encourages the research and spread of new technologies, as seen in programs such as NASA</li>
  <li>The patent system encourages research and development for financial gain</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Population Growth</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The effects of population growth have been long debated
    <ul>
      <li>Larger populations lead to more production because of the increased amount of labor</li>
      <li>Larger populations lead to higher consumption which can decrease the standard of living at large</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Population growth also affects factors of production in other ways</li>
  <li>
<em>Stretching Natural Resources</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Thomas Malthus argued that population growth would outpace the production of food, thus leading to “misery and vice”</li>
      <li>Malthus’ theory was incorrect largely due to his failure to account for technological advances in food production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Diluting the Capital Stock</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Some theorize that high population growth reduces the GDP per worker because more workers causes capital, both physical and human, to be spread more thinly</li>
      <li>This is most prevalent in poorer countries where the population growth is 3% compared to 1% in developed countries like the US
        <ul>
          <li>Some countries, like China, forced population growth down through their one-child policy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Income equality can encourage population growth to decrease due to the increased opportunity cost of bearing a child</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<em>Promoting Technological Progress</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The more people there are, the more geniuses, engineers, scientists, etc. there are to help improve technology
        <ul>
          <li>This theory has been supported by articles and studies in the past</li>
          <li>Larger populations grow at a faster rate due to the discovery of technological advancements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
